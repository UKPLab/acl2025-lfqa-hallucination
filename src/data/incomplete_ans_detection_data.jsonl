I heard someone mention in 1997 national front used the UK flag, I googled national front and couldnt find much explaining what exactly it was, a racist political group? A brexit like group that was against UK having people from other countries move to the Uk? Explain please\nAnswer: 1. The national front was a far-right political party in the Uk, known for its racist and anti-immigration views.\n2. It gained prominence during the 1970s and 1980s, advocating for policies that excluded non-white citizens and promoted white nationalism.\n3. The party used the UK flag as a symbol to champion their ethnocentric beliefs, as they saw themselves as protecting \"traditional\" british culture and identity.\n4. While not exactly like the brexit movement, which mainly focused on leaving the European union, the national front did share some common goals, such as reducing immigration and preserving national sovereignty.\n5. One notable example of their activities was their involvement in street protests and violent confrontations with anti-racist groups.\n6. The party eventually lost its influence due to internal divisions and the rise of more moderate organizations addressing similar issues, like the UK independence party (ukip).\n7. However, the national front's legacy still exists in some far-right and nationalist movements in the UK today.",

        "input": "Question: Why do people often say diet sodas are just as bad or worse than regular sodas?\nAnswer: 1. Diet sodas are often considered just as bad or worse than regular sodas because they contain artificial sweeteners instead of sugar.\n2. These sweeteners, like aspartame or sucralose, can have negative effects on the body.\n3. For example, they may confuse the body's natural ability to regulate calorie intake by tricking it into thinking it's consuming real sugar.\n4. This can lead to overeating and weight gain.\n5. Additionally, some studies have suggested that artificial sweeteners might negatively impact gut bacteria, potentially leading to health issues.\n6. While diet sodas have fewer calories than regular sodas, they can still contribute to poor overall health due to these artificial ingredients.\n7. Therefore, many people believe they are no better than, or even worse than, regular sodas.",

        "input": "Question: Why did the land now known as Germany have a history of being so divided? I\u2019m not talking cold war, or even anything after 1900, but basically everything that happened before 1900 for hundreds of years we had things like the holy roman empire and various other entities but from my interpretation of maps i\u2019ve seen, it seems like they were never really able to properly unify it into one state, even well after other countries in Europe, figured out how to be large without all that chaos\nAnswer: 1. Germany's historical division can be attributed to its complex makeup of various tribes, cultures, and the political structure of the holy roman empire.\n2. While other European countries gradually centralized power and formed unified nation-states, Germany remained a patchwork of smaller territories and duchies for many centuries.\n3. During the middle ages, the area now known as Germany was home to numerous tribes and cultures, each with distinct identities and regional powers.\n4. The holy roman empire, which included most of the German-speaking lands, was a loose confederation of states with a decentralized political structure.\n5. The emperor had limited power, and the numerous regional leaders (princes, dukes, and bishops) held considerable autonomy within their respective territories.\n6. The thirty years' war (1618-1648) further fragmented the region, devastating its population and economy.\n7. After the war, the 1648 treaty of westphalia confirmed the sovereignty and independence of the German states, which further slowed the process of unification.\n8. It wasn't until the 19th century, with the rise of nationalism and prussian leadership, that the German states began to unite.\n9. Under prussian influence, Germany finally unified into a single nation-state in 1871, forming the German empire.",

        "input": "Question: How do hot and cool patches work? I hurt my back yesterday and am having to wear these patches to ease the pain. I\u2019m curious about how they work. How do they alternate between hot and cold?\nAnswer: 1. Hot and cool patches work by providing either heat or cold to the affected area, which can help alleviate pain and promote healing.\n2. These patches contain specific ingredients that create a heating or cooling effect when applied to the skin.\n3. Heat patches typically contain iron powder, activated carbon, and other ingredients like salt and water.\n4. When the patch is exposed to air, the iron powder reacts with oxygen, generating heat.\n5. This heat penetrates the skin, helping to increase blood flow and relax tight muscles, thus reducing pain.\n6. On the other hand, cool patches often contain menthol, an organic compound extracted from mint oils.\n7. When applied to the skin, menthol triggers the cold-sensitive receptors, providing a cooling sensation.\n8. This helps to numb the area and decrease inflammation, which contributes to pain relief.\n9. Hot and cool patches generally do not alternate between hot and cold, but are separate types of patches that you can choose depending on your needs.\n10. You can use heat patches for muscle stiffness or aches, while cool patches are more suitable for acute injuries, like sprains or strains, where inflammation and swelling are present.\n11.

Ethanol alcohol doesn't actually \"expire\" but loses its effectiveness as a sanitizer over time.\n2. This happens because ethanol is volatile and evaporates when exposed to air, reducing its concentration.\n3. As the concentration of ethanol decreases below 60-70%, it becomes less effective in killing germs.\n4.

        "input": "Question: My coworker said \"the house market is f****d cause they keep raising interest rates\". What does that mean?\nAnswer: 1. In simple terms, when interest rates increase, it becomes more expensive to borrow money.\n2. This directly affects the housing market because most people rely on mortgages, which are loans used to buy homes.\n3. Higher interest rates mean that the monthly mortgage payments will be higher for the same amount of money borrowed.\n4. Consequently, people might not be able to afford the same house they could if the interest rates were lower.\n5. This can result in reduced demand for homes, causing the housing market to slow down.\n6. Furthermore, existing homeowners might have a harder time selling their homes, as potential buyers might be unable to afford the higher mortgage payments.\n7.

        "input": "Question: The controversy surrounding general electric as run under jack welch or jeff immelt? I had a reading for my mba class tonight that was a piece written by jeff immelt, former CEO of general electric, right before he left the company. The class discussion was probably the most animated discussion of the whole class so far. [the article](https://hbr.org/2017/09/inside-ges-transformation) on its own merits didn't seem controversial, as they were standard change management material, but emotions ran high during discussion, and I was confused.\nAnswer: 1. The controversy surrounding general electric (ge) under jack welch and jeff immelt mainly revolves around their management styles, business strategies, and the company's performance during their tenures as ceos.\n2. Jack welch served as ge's CEO from 1981 to 2001 and was a highly regarded business leader.\n3. During his time, the company's market value grew from $14 billion to $410 billion.\n4. He achieved this through aggressive cost-cutting measures, extensive employee layoffs, and focusing on businesses where ge could be number one or number two in the industry.\n5. However, his management style was also criticized as ruthless and excessively focused on short-term gains, potentially sacrificing long-term growth and stability.\n6. Jeff immelt took over as CEO from 2001 to 2017.\n7. He inherited a company with a heavy focus on financial services, which turned out to be a major risk during the financial crisis of 2008.\n8. Immelt tried to reshape the company by diversifying into different industries, such as healthcare and renewable energy, and investing in digital technology.\n9. However, the company's performance under immelt was lackluster, with its market value declining significantly during his tenure.\n10. In the article you've mentioned, immelt talks about the steps he took to transform ge during his time as ceo.\n11. While the article itself is focused on change management, it ignited a debate in your class because of the broader context of ge's performance and the legacy of both ceos.\n12. Supporters of welch and critics of immelt may argue that immelt's leadership led to ge's decline, while others may argue that he inherited a difficult situation from welch's aggressive strategies.\n13. This is likely what led to the animated discussion in your class, as opinions on the success or failure of these two CEOS and their respective strategies differ greatly.",

        "input": "Question: How did archaeologists decipher ancient texts accurately without knowing anything about it? How do they even start deciphering 1000 year old texts?\nAnswer: 1. Archaeologists decipher ancient texts by using a combination of clues, context, and comparison to known languages or scripts.\n2. The process begins with identifying patterns, such as repeating symbols, phrases, or structures, which suggest a form of language or writing system.\n3. One effective method is to find a bilingual inscription, like the rosetta stone.\n4. The rosetta stone, discovered in 1799, contained a decree written in three scripts: ancient greek, egyptian hieroglyphics, and demotic script.\n5. Because scholars already knew ancient greek, they used it as a key to understand the other two scripts.\n6. This breakthrough allowed them to decipher egyptian hieroglyphics accurately.\n7. Another method is to analyze the context in which the text is found.\n8. Cultural and historical context can provide valuable information about the people who used the language.\n9. For example, if an inscription is found on a tomb or monument, it might indicate that the text is related to funerary rites or commemorating an important figure.\n10. This can help archaeologists narrow down possible meanings and establish the purpose of the text.\n11. Finally, linguists and experts in the field compare the unknown script with known languages or writing systems.\n12. By identifying similarities or shared elements, scholars can make educated guesses about the structure, grammar, and vocabulary of the unknown language.\n13.

New england states rely on home heating oil primarily due to historical reasons and infrastructure limitations.\n2. When these states modernized their heating systems in the early-to-mid 1900s, natural gas wasn't readily available, so they chose oil-based systems.\n3. As natural gas became more popular in other parts of the country, new england's infrastructure wasn't easily adaptable to switch from oil-based systems to natural gas.\n4. Thus, they continued using home heating oil, which remains the case today, despite being more expensive and less environmentally friendly than other heating options.",
        "output": "1. [Incomplete] Reasons: The answer could mention the advantages of using home heating oil.

In addition, oil produces more heat than wood or coal furnaces.

[Incomplete] Reasons: The answer could explain the reason for this. New England had a well-established infrastructure built around oil, including storage tanks, pipelines, and delivery systems. Adapting this existing infrastructure to accommodate natural gas would require significant investments and modifications. Factors like these have led to a limited pipeline capacity to meet the rising power demands for heating and cooling during periods of extreme weather."

The us's divergence from other developed countries on social policies, like universal healthcare and paid sick leave, has roots in various historical and cultural factors.\n2. One major factor is the strong emphasis on individualism in American society, which has led to a preference for limited government intervention.\n3. Additionally, powerful interest groups, like private healthcare providers, have actively lobbied against such policies.\n4. While this began well before reagan, his presidency did strengthen this trend by promoting free market policies and reducing government spending on social programs.\n5.

When pasta is made, the flour or semolina is mixed with water to form a dough, which is then shaped into various pasta forms.\n2. During this process, the proteins in the flour, mainly gluten, form a network that gives the pasta structure and elasticity.\n3. This network is stable once the pasta is dried, preventing it from turning back into flour/semolina.\n4. When you cook pasta in water, it doesn't dissolve because this protein network is strong enough to maintain its shape.\n5.

        "input": "Question: Why did famous authors like orwell, joyce, kafka, tolstoy etc. Not get a nobel literature prize despite their hallmark contributions to literature?\nAnswer: 1. The nobel prize in literature is awarded to authors for their outstanding contributions in the world of literature.\n2. However, several famous authors like orwell, joyce, kafka, and tolstoy did not receive this prestigious award despite their significant literary achievements.\n3. There are a few factors that can contribute to this discrepancy:1.\n4. Timing: the nobel prize is traditionally awarded to living authors, and its selection committee may not have recognized the significance of an author's work during their lifetime.\n5. For example, kafka and joyce received significant recognition only after their deaths, missing out on the opportunity to be considered for the prize.\n6. 2.\n7. Subjectivity: the selection of nobel prize winners involves a degree of subjectivity.\n8. Different individuals and generations may have varying opinions on the importance and relevance of a particular author's work.\n9. The nobel committee is composed of members with diverse tastes and preferences, so it is possible that they were not unanimous in considering these authors for the prize.\n10. 3.\n11. Controversy: some authors, like orwell and joyce, created works that were controversial for their time.\n12. The nobel committee might have been hesitant to award prizes to authors with works that provoked strong reactions or challenged societal norms, as it could generate negative publicity for the institution.\n13.

[Incomplete] Reasons: The answer should provide contextual or clarifying information about the controversial works of Orwell and Joyce. For example, when George Orwell wrote and released '1984' in 1949, it was intended as a scathing critique of totalitarian regimes and the oppression of individualism and free will, being promptly banned in the Soviet Union on release (https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1988/05/13/soviets-will-publish-1984/0d86d3e1-a36d-4930-8afa-47653281dd95/).

As another example, James Joyce's 'Ulysses', published in 1920, was challenged in a New York court for its 'obscenity' and was banned in the United States of America in 1921. It was also banned in the United Kingdom in 1922. Joyce's 'Ulysses' was considered 'obscene' owing to graphic details of sex and debauchery as well as numerous swearing, and the legal standards of the time in the United States considered it as violating the law. Section 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (Title 19, United States Code, Section 1305) states that 'All persons are prohibited from importing into the United States from any foreign country\u2026 any obscene book, pamphlet, paper\u2026 [etc]', the State (prosecution) convinced the Judge that 'Ulysses' was 'obscene' by the 'living standard (today called 'reasonableness) of the day' (see: Bradshaw, David.

        "input": "Question: If a borrower is high-risk, why do banks make it harder for them to pay off loans? It seems like hiking interest rates for loans for higher risk borrowers is counterintuitive. If they have to pay significantly more, aren't they more likely to default?\nAnswer: 1. The main idea behind raising interest rates for high-risk borrowers is reflecting the increased risk the bank takes when lending money.\n2. Think of lending money as a business.\n3. The bank's goal is to lend money and earn interest on those loans, which is their profit.\n4. However, they also need to weigh the risk of not getting paid back.\n5. When a borrower is considered high-risk (based on credit history, income, or other factors), it means that the bank believes there is a higher likelihood of them not paying back the loan.\n6. To account for this increased risk, banks charge higher interest rates to high-risk borrowers.\n7. This way, they can offset potential losses from some loans that may not be paid back, with extra earnings from the higher interest on other loans.\n8. It's like putting extra insurance on something valuable you are lending to someone who might not be careful with it.\n9. However, it's important to note that banks do not want their borrowers to default on loans, so they take several measures to minimize this risk.\n10. They may require a larger down payment, ask for additional collateral or execute background checks, among other things.\n11. And when it comes to interest rates, banks assess various factors to calculate the rate that keeps default risk manageable while still making a profit.\n12. Ultimately, the practice of charging higher interest rates to high-risk borrowers is not intended to make it harder for them to pay off loans.\n13. Rather, it's a way for the bank to balance the risks involved in lending money to borrowers with different credit profiles, while still being able to make a profit.",

        "input": "Question: What is the difference between median and average? I was looking up the average networth of 30 year olds in the United states and it said: \"the average net worth is $122,000 and the median net worth is $35,112\" my brain is too smooth please help.\nAnswer: 1. The main difference between median and average is how they represent the central tendency of a dataset.\n2. In simple terms, the average (also known as the mean) is calculated by adding together all the values in a dataset and then dividing that sum by the total number of values.\n3. The median, on the other hand, is the middle value of the dataset when all values are arranged in ascending order.\n4. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n5. To illustrate this, let's consider an example.\n6. Imagine ten 30-year-olds with varying net worths: $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $60,000, and $500,000.\n7. The average net worth would be calculated by adding all these values together, which equals $780,000, and then dividing by 10 (the total number of values), resulting in $78,000.\n8. The median net worth, however, involves identifying the middle value, which in this case is $35,000, because there are five values smaller and five values larger.\n9.

The steam then expands to take up a larger volume, which can be around 1700 times the original volume of the water.\n4. This expansion occurs because steam has lower density compared to liquid water, meaning that the same mass of steam needs more space.\n5.

        "input": "Question: If people all decide to remove their money from a bank at the same time, does it have a serious economic impact? I ask because since our money is backed in value (a precious resource like gold and oil) and doesn\u2019t leave the country, doesn\u2019t it also mean that our wealth remains intact as a nation regardless of whether or not the bank has it? (ie, us citizens have it, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in a bank or not- the wealth is held by a u. S. Citizen).\nAnswer: 1. Yes, if people all decide to remove their money from a bank at the same time, it can have a serious economic impact.\n2. This phenomenon is called a \"bank run.\n3. \" it's important to understand that banks operate on a system called fractional reserve banking, where they only hold a fraction of the deposits as reserves and loan out the rest to generate profits.\n4. When many people withdraw their money simultaneously, banks may not have enough liquid assets (cash) to fulfill all the withdrawal requests.\n5. To meet the demands, they may be forced to sell other assets like loans or investments, which could be sold at a loss, affecting the bank's financial stability.\n6. This can cause a domino effect on other banks and the larger economy, leading to a financial crisis.\n7. Although it's true that the wealth remains in the country, the issue is the confidence in the banking system.\n8. If people lose faith in banks' ability to safeguard their money, it can lead to a situation where everyone starts to hoard cash, spend less, and reduce their economic activity, slowing down the economy.\n9. Additionally, banks play a crucial role in facilitating lending and borrowing, which is essential for economic growth.\n10. If banks face a crisis, they may reduce lending or even collapse, leading to credit crunches, business closures, and increased unemployment.\n11. In summary, when people remove their money from banks all at once, it can potentially destabilize the banking system and the entire economy, even if the wealth remains in the country through citizens' holdings.\n12. The reduced confidence and disruption of financial services can lead to significant negative consequences.",

        "input": "Question: How the $1 trillion coin minted by the United states and deposited into the treasury doesn't help resolve the outstanding debt without ramifications.\nAnswer: 1. The concept of minting a $1 trillion coin to resolve outstanding debt is based on a legal loophole in the United states, which allows the treasury to mint platinum coins of any denomination.\n2. However, while this may seem like a straightforward solution to paying off national debt, it would have significant economic ramifications.\n3. First, let's discuss how the $1 trillion coin would work.\n4. The treasury would mint the coin and then deposit it into the federal reserve.\n5. In exchange, the federal reserve would credit the treasury's account with $1 trillion, which could then be used to pay off outstanding debt.\n6. This would not require creating any new taxes or borrowing money, hence the appeal of the idea.\n7. However, using the $1 trillion coin as a solution to the debt crisis would have adverse effects on the economy.\n8. One major issue is inflation.\n9. Injecting $1 trillion into the economy could cause a sudden and dramatic increase in the overall money supply, which in turn could lead to rapid inflation.\n10. Inflation diminishes the value of money, making it more expensive for people to purchase goods and services, resulting in an overall decrease in purchasing power.\n11. Moreover, the $1 trillion coin would undermine the trust and confidence in the u.\n12. S.\n13. Financial system.\n14. The government would essentially be creating money out of thin air, thereby raising concerns among domestic and international investors about its ability to manage its finances responsibly.\n15. This could lead to a loss of confidence in the u.\n16. S.\n17. Dollar and further destabilize the global economy.\n18. Furthermore, using the $1 trillion coin to combat the debt problem would only be a temporary solution.\n19. The u.\n20. S.\n21. Government runs a budget deficit most years, meaning it spends more than it earns in taxes.\n22. Relying on such an unconventional method to address debt would not address the root causes of the problem, such as high government spending and inefficient taxation mechanisms.\n23. In conclusion, while the $1 trillion coin may initially appear to be a simple solution to the u.\n24. S.\n25. Debt problem, it would likely result in inflation, undermine confidence in the u.\n26. S.\n27. Financial system, and fail to address the root causes of the problem.\n28. It is essential to approach the issue through more sustainable methods, such as reducing government expenditures,",

        "input": "Question: How can a fabric be hydrophobic but also absorb oils and gas? I work at an airport and we use \u201cpig pads\u201d which are absorbent sheets that can be placed on a pool of water and only absorb the fuel, oils, or whatever else while not absorbing any water. What about the sheets allows this?\nAnswer: 1. Hydrophobic fabric can absorb oils and gas while repelling water due to specific properties of the material and the difference in the molecular structure of water and oil.\n2. To understand this, we need to break down the concepts of hydrophobicity and oil absorption.\n3. Hydrophobic materials have a natural aversion to water, which means they repel it instead of absorbing it.\n4. This occurs because the molecules on the surface of the material have a weak attraction to water molecules.\n5. Water molecules, on the other hand, are attracted to each other strongly, causing them to stick together and form a droplet that rolls off the hydrophobic surface.\n6. Oil and gas, however, have a different molecular structure than water.\n7. Unlike water, which is a polar molecule (having a partial positive and negative charge), oil and gas molecules are nonpolar.\n8. This means that the attractive forces between oil molecules are not as strong as those between water molecules.\n9. The pig pads used at airports are made from materials that are specifically designed to attract and absorb nonpolar substances like oil and gas, while repelling polar substances like water.\n10. They do this by incorporating oleophilic (oil-attracting) components in the material.\n11. These components have a stronger affinity for the nonpolar molecules found in oil, causing them to be drawn into the pad and absorbed.\n12. So, in summary, pig pads can absorb oils and gas while remaining hydrophobic due to the material's selective affinity toward nonpolar substances and their ability to repel polar substances like water.\n13. This is made possible by the difference in molecular structure and forces of attraction present in water and oil.",

When you shine a light inside a perfect mirror ball, you create an infinite number of reflections bouncing around inside the sphere.\n2. The basic concept here is reflection, where light bounces off surfaces like mirrors at the same angle it hits them.\n3. Imagine you're holding a flashlight and pointing it at a flat mirror.\n4. The light reflects off the mirror at the same angle it comes in.\n5. Now, let's take that concept and apply it to a perfect mirror ball.\n6. The mirror ball has a curved surface, which means that light rays will bounce off at different angles, creating more reflections.\n7. Since the inside of the ball is also mirrored, those reflected rays will bounce off again, creating even more reflections.\n8. Now, in an ideal situation, where the ball is a perfect mirror and there's no loss of light (no absorption or scattering), these reflections would continue indefinitely, creating an intricate pattern of light inside the ball.\n9. In reality, though, no mirror is perfect, and some light will be absorbed or scattered, eventually fading away.\n10.

Stainless steel is a type of steel that has at least 10.\n2. 5% chromium added to it.\n3. This chromium forms a protective layer of chromium oxide on the steel's surface, which prevents rust and corrosion.\n4. The more chromium added, the stronger the corrosion resistance.\n5. Regular steel, on the other hand, lacks this protective layer, allowing it to rust and corrode over time.\n6. In summary, stainless steel is \"stainless\" because of the added chromium that creates a protective layer, making it more resistant to rust and corrosion than regular steel.",

This process is called nuclear fission.\n3. It doesn't work by splitting just one atom; instead, a chain reaction is needed, where multiple atoms are split rapidly.\n4. This chain reaction starts when a neutron hits an unstable atom (like uranium or plutonium), causing it to split and release more neutrons.\n5. These released neutrons then hit other atoms, causing them to split as well.\n6. To initiate this chain reaction, a small amount of material called a \"critical mass\" is required.\n7.

The process of making bread from wheat evolved gradually over time.\n2. Ancient humans first started by eating wild grains for nourishment.\n3. They then discovered that crushing these grains (milling) made them easier to eat and digest.\n4. When mixed with water, they formed a paste that could be cooked on hot stones, creating a basic flatbread.\n5. Over time, they learned to cultivate and selectively breed wheat, allowing them to grow taller and produce more grains.\n6.

Since element numbers are based on protons, why can't they just add more to discover element 119, 120, etc?\nAnswer: 1. The difficulty in discovering and creating new elements mainly lies in their instability and the challenges faced during their production process.\n2. Elements are determined by the number of protons in their nucleus, with each element having a unique number of protons.\n3. As we move up the periodic table, elements have more protons and, consequently, an increased number of neutrons to help hold the nucleus together.\n4. However, the forces holding a large nucleus together become weaker as it grows in size.\n5. This is due to the fact that, inside the nucleus, two competing forces are at play: the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons together, and the electromagnetic force, which causes repulsion between protons.\n6. While the strong nuclear force has a powerful but limited range, the electromagnetic force has a weaker but much longer range.\n7. In bigger nuclei, this results in an unstable balance between these forces.\n8. In addition to the instability, the production process for creating new elements is challenging.\n9. New elements are generally created by smashing atoms together at extremely high speeds using particle accelerators.\n10. This process requires precise conditions and immense amount of energy, and even under such circumstances, the resulting elements often exist for just fractions of a second before decaying into more stable, lighter elements, making them difficult to study or produce in practical quantities.",

        "input": "Question: How did the us screw up health insurance so bad?\nAnswer: 1. The us healthcare system's issues mainly stem from it being a hybrid of private and public institutions, leading to inefficiencies, high costs, and limited access to healthcare for some people.\n2. One key factor is the dominance of private insurance companies.\n3. Since these companies are profit-driven, they have an incentive to prioritize their earnings over providing affordable healthcare.\n4. This can lead to high insurance premiums and deductibles, pricing many people out of comprehensive coverage.\n5. Another issue comes from the unequal distribution of healthcare resources.\n6. The us spends a lot more on healthcare than other developed countries, yet its outcomes are not much better.\n7. This is because the focus is often on expensive medical technologies, rather than on prevention and primary care services.\n8. Additionally, the us does not have a single-payer system (like many other countries).\n9. This means there's no public organization negotiating with providers for lower prices.\n10. As a result, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies can charge much higher prices.\n11. The lack of price regulation contributes to the high costs of medical care and medications in the us.\n12.

        "input": "Question: <- what are the pros/cons of borrowing money from the bank vs paying cash when buying a house? And why would it ever be a good idea to borrow if you can pay cash and pay no interest to the bank?\nAnswer: 1. The main advantage of borrowing money from a bank (a mortgage) to buy a house is that it allows you to purchase a property without having all the cash up front.\n2. This enables people to become homeowners earlier in life and potentially benefit from the appreciation of the home's value.\n3. Paying a mortgage also helps build credit history, which can be beneficial for obtaining future loans or credit cards.\n4. On the other hand, paying cash for a house has the advantage of no interest costs, which can save a substantial amount of money over time.\n5. Cash buyers may also have more negotiating power, as they are not reliant on bank approval and can close the deal quickly.\n6. In certain situations, it can be better to borrow money even if you have the cash.\n7. This is because investing the cash into diversified investments (stocks, bonds, etc.\n8. ) may provide better returns than paying off the mortgage early, although it comes with some level of risk.\n9. Additionally, having cash reserves can provide financial flexibility for emergencies or future opportunities.",

However, plumbers often dislike using drano for several reasons.\n3. First, drano can be harmful to the environment and the user.\n4. The chemicals in drano, like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, can cause skin irritations and are hazardous if ingested or inhaled.\n5. When mixed with water, these chemicals create heat, which can lead to burns and damage to surfaces.\n6. Additionally, chemical drain cleaners can contaminate waterways and harm aquatic life when it eventually gets washed away.\n7. Second, drano can potentially damage pipes, especially if used repeatedly or improperly.\n8. The heat produced by drano's chemical reaction can cause pvc pipes to weaken over time, and the corrosive chemicals can damage older, corroded pipes made of metal.\n9. Drano may also not entirely dissolve certain materials, forming a sludge-like substance that can be difficult to clean up.\n10. This leads to further buildup in pipes, and plumbers are often left dealing with the mess.\n11. Lastly, drano is often seen as a temporary solution to clogged pipes.\n12. While it may provide short-term relief, it doesn't address the root cause of the clog, such as improper disposal of cooking grease or a broken pipe.\n13. Plumbers prefer to determine and fix the underlying issue, rather than continuously using a chemical that could cause more harm than good in the long run.",

Trade was also important and a key element of the power of Mayan and subsequently Aztec society, particularly in major cities belonging to Mayan or Aztec peoples, was primarily confined to Mesoamerica and eventually centered on Tenochtitlan, the then-capital of the Aztec Empire, see (https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/resource-library-mesoamerica/) and Smith, Michael E. \u201cLONG-DISTANCE TRADE UNDER THE AZTEC EMPIRE: The Archaeological Evidence.\u201d Ancient Mesoamerica 1, no. 2 (1990): 153\u201369.

What's the science behind this?\nAnswer: 1. Exercise has a significant impact on the brain because it promotes the release of various beneficial chemicals and supports overall brain health.\n2. When you exercise, your brain experiences increased blood flow, which delivers more oxygen and nutrients to your brain cells, helping them work more efficiently.\n3. One of the main chemicals released during exercise is endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood elevators.\n4. They help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, contributing to the improved mood and mental clarity you experience after a workout.\n5. Exercise also stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), a protein that supports the growth and survival of your brain cells.\n6. Bdnf helps to enhance memory and learning, which may contribute to the increased motivation and focus you notice.\n7. Moreover, exercise aids in regulating neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, which play crucial roles in mood regulation, motivation, and overall feelings of well-being.\n8. Consistent exercise also helps reduce inflammation and supports the growth of new blood vessels in the brain.\n9. When you go days without exercising, your brain may experience a reduction in these beneficial chemicals and effects, leading to brain fog, depression, and anxiety.\n10.

Home printers are often less reliable than industrial printers for books, newspapers, and magazines because they are designed for different purposes, have varying levels of quality, and face different expectations.\n2. First, home printers are made for occasional low-volume printing, whereas industrial printers are designed specifically for high-volume, consistent use.\n3. Because of this, industrial printers have more robust and durable components that can handle the demands of prolonged usage, while home printers are less sturdy.\n4. Second, home printers tend to be more affordable and have lower-quality components.\n5. This means that they might not operate as smoothly or efficiently as their industrial counterparts.\n6.

When things are heated, their molecules move faster and spread out, causing the substance to expand, which is known as thermal expansion.\n2. In the case of cake dough, the heat from the oven causes the baking powder or baking soda to react, producing gas bubbles.\n3.

        "input": "Question: Why are lab-grown gemstones still relatively small? I think the largest disclosed un-certified gem right now is a 155 carat diamond. Which, sure, it's a big gem. But if it was possible to make unreasonably large gems, we'd be seeing one-piece emerald kitchen counter slabs on the market right now and people with enough means would be making gemstone windows.\nAnswer: 1. The main reason why lab-grown gemstones are still relatively small is due to the limitations in the growing process and the increasing complexity and costs associated with creating larger gemstones.\n2. To create lab-grown gemstones, scientists use methods like the czochralski process or the high-pressure high-temperature (hpht) process.\n3. These methods involve placing a small \"seed\" of the desired gemstone material in a controlled environment where the necessary elements are then allowed to grow around this seed, forming the gemstone.\n4. However, as the gemstone gets bigger, the challenge of maintaining a stable growth environment increases.\n5. This means that producing larger gemstones takes more time, effort, and resources, and the chance of errors and imperfections also rises.\n6. For example, maintaining a consistent temperature and pressure throughout a large gemstone is extremely difficult.\n7. Any irregularities (i.\n8. E.\n9. , fluctuations in temperature and pressure) can lead to internal cracks and other defects in the final product, making it less desirable and valuable.\n10. Another factor is the costs associated with producing larger gemstones.\n11. The raw materials, energy consumption, and specialized equipment required for the growth process tend to become more expensive as the size of the gemstone increases.\n12. In summary, the reasons for the limited size of lab-grown gemstones primarily revolve around the challenges in the growing process, the increased complexity and risk of defects, and the higher costs associated with producing larger gemstones.\n13. As a result, we do not currently see unreasonably large lab-grown gemstones, such as one-piece emerald kitchen counter slabs or gemstone windows.",

Their organs like the liver and kidneys, which help process drugs, aren't as efficient as adults', so lower doses are necessary to prevent potential side effects or toxicity.\n3. However, for adults, the difference in drug dosages isn't always determined by weight alone.\n4. Other factors such as metabolism, genetics, and body composition play a part too.\n5.

Basically, who is loving life right now?\nAnswer: 1. When interest rates rise in Australia, several parties potentially benefit.\n2. The primary beneficiaries are banks and financial institutions holding your mortgage.\n3. As interest rates increase, the amount you pay on your mortgage goes up, resulting in higher profits for the banks.\n4. Another group that may profit from higher interest rates is savers and investors.\n5. When interest rates rise, banks usually increase the interest rates on savings accounts and term deposits.\n6.

        "input": "Question: Is inflation inevitable in all successful economies? Throughout history, has there ever been a society that maintained 0% inflation for a long term while still maintaining a good quality of life?\nAnswer: 1. Inflation refers to the gradual increase in the prices of goods and services over time, which results in a decrease in the purchasing power of money.\n2. In most successful economies, some level of inflation is considered normal and even desirable.\n3. However, the question of whether inflation is inevitable in all successful economies is complex and depends on several factors.\n4. First, let's understand why inflation occurs.\n5. One of the primary reasons is the growth of the money supply.\n6. When governments or central banks create more money, there is more money chasing a limited amount of goods and services, which can drive up prices.\n7. Additionally, inflation can be driven by increased demand for goods and services, rising production costs, or external factors, such as changes in exchange rates or global economic conditions.\n8. Now, returning to the question of the inevitability of inflation, it is important to understand the concept of the inflation target.\n9. Most modern central banks aim for a low, stable rate of inflation\u2014usually around 2%\u2014as this is seen as promoting price stability, encouraging spending, and fostering economic growth.\n10. Therefore, even in successful economies, some inflation is not only expected but also actively managed and maintained.\n11. As for whether there has ever been a society that maintained 0% inflation for a long term while still maintaining a good quality of life, the answer is not entirely clear.\n12. Economic data from ancient societies is generally scarce or nonexistent, making it difficult to determine their inflation rates or living standards with precision.\n13. Furthermore, the concept of a 0% inflation target is a relatively modern one, and it is not clear that such an idea would have been understood or pursued by ancient societies.\n14. That being said, there have been periods of low or negligible inflation in more recent history.\n15. For instance, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries adhered to the gold standard\u2014a system in which currencies were backed by a specific amount of gold.\n16. During this period, inflation rates were generally quite low, as the money supply was tied to the amount of gold held in reserves.\n17. However, the gold standard also had its limitations and was eventually abandoned by most countries in the 20th century.\n18. In conclusion, while achieving long-term 0% inflation may not be considered an explicit goal of successful economies, some level of price stability is desirable.\n19. Modern central banks usually aim for low, stable inflation rates to foster economic growth and maintain a good quality of life.\n20. As for historical examples of societies that maintained low or zero inflation, data is scarce and often inconclusive.\n21. However, it's essential to recognize that maintaining a low inflation rate is considered a part of a healthy and successful economy.",

Apples and cherries are examples of fruits that are challenging to breed seedless varieties because they are produced by pollination involving both male and female parts.\n4.

At 3551 c, [mu cephei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mu_cephei) earned the name \"herschel's garnet star\", and this is not a reference to uvarovite.\nAnswer: 1. Red stars appear red because of the way they emit light, which is related to their temperature.\n2. The color of a star's light depends on its surface temperature, following a principle known as \"blackbody radiation.\n3. \" stars behave like near-perfect blackbodies, meaning they emit a continuous spectrum of light across various wavelengths.\n4. The spectrum of light emitted by a star peaks at a specific wavelength, which is determined by its temperature.\n5. This peak wavelength follows wien's law, which basically states that hotter objects emit light with shorter wavelengths, while cooler objects emit light with longer wavelengths.\n6. In the context of stars, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.\n7. As a result, red stars actually have lower surface temperatures than blue ones.\n8.

        "input": "Question: How do banks fail and what happens next? Hey everyone. Been seeing a lot of articles about silicon valley bank failing. Says it was the first big bank since 2008 to do so.\nAnswer: 1. Banks fail when they are no longer able to meet their financial obligations, either because they have taken on excessive risk or have encountered unforeseen circumstances that result in significant losses.\n2. This can lead to a situation where a bank is unable to return the money to its depositors, pay its debts, or continue its normal operations.\n3. There are several reasons that can lead to a bank's failure:1.\n4. Bad loans: banks lend money to borrowers, expecting them to repay the loans with interest.\n5. If too many borrowers fail to repay their loans, the bank can face losses too large to recover from.\n6. 2.\n7. Poor investments: banks can invest in various assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate.\n8. If those investments perform poorly, the bank can experience financial strains and might not be able to cover its liabilities.\n9. 3.\n10. Insufficient capital: banks are required to maintain a certain amount of capital to cover potential losses.\n11. If a bank doesn't accumulate enough capital, it can become vulnerable to financial difficulties.\n12. 4.\n13. Economic downturn: during periods of economic decline, banks may encounter higher loan defaults, lower lending and investment opportunities, and decreased profitability.\n14. When a bank fails, regulatory authorities step in to protect the customers and the overall financial system.\n15. In the United states, the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) oversees the process.\n16. The fdic may either find a buyer for the failing bank or liquidate its assets to pay back the depositors, up to a certain limit.\n17. This limit ensures the majority of depositors get their money back, which helps prevent panic among customers of other banks.\n18. In some cases, the government may choose to bail out a failing bank to prevent further financial harm to the economy, as was the case in the 2008 financial crisis.\n19. However, government bailouts may include conditions such as restructuring or downsizing the bank.\n20. In summary, banks fail when they can no longer meet their financial obligations due to excessive risk-taking or unforeseen circumstances.\n21.

        "input": "Question: Why trains aren't driverless I really don't see the need to have a driver in a vehicle on rails.\nAnswer: 1. Trains are not completely driverless primarily due to safety concerns and technological limitations.\n2. While the technology for driverless trains exists, incorporating it into various train systems can be challenging, and the risks associated with a malfunction are significantly higher than with self-driving cars.\n3. Firstly, trains often travel along complex routes with various junctions and signals that require human interaction to navigate safely.\n4. A driver must react to unexpected changes in the environment, such as fallen trees, track damage, or passengers who may be on the tracks.\n5. Although advancements in technology have made it possible to automate these decisions, it is still often considered safer to keep a driver in the locomotive.\n6. Secondly, there is a logistical challenge in upgrading existing rail networks to accommodate driverless trains.\n7. Implementing this technology would likely require substantial investment in infrastructure and safety measures.\n8. Lastly, social and regulatory aspects come into play.\n9. The workforce responsible for driving trains, and the unions representing them, would need to negotiate the transition to a driverless system, embracing the change and addressing potential job losses.\n10. In summary, while driverless trains are technologically feasible, safety concerns, logistical challenges, and social considerations have prevented them from",

I just seen a post showing a picture of a stack of (at least) 1000 notes of 20's in vb (venezuelan bolivar), which is apparently only equal to 1 us dollar.\nAnswer: 1. Countries recover from hyperinflation by stabilizing their economies and restoring confidence in their currencies.\n2. This often involves a combination of fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms.\n3. 1.\n4. Fiscal policies: governments address their budget deficits by either increasing revenue (through taxes) or reducing spending.\n5. This helps to control the amount of money in circulation and demonstrates the government's commitment to financial stability.\n6. 2.\n7. Monetary policies: central banks can introduce a new currency, often pegged to a stable foreign currency like the us dollar, to regain people's trust in the value of money.\n8. This can be achieved by exchanging the old, inflated currency for the new one at a fixed rate.\n9. Central banks may also raise interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing and restrict the money supply.\n10. 3.\n11. Structural reforms: to support long-term economic stability, governments may implement policies that encourage business and investments such as privatizing state-owned enterprises, deregulating industries, and improving governance and transparency.\n12. For instance, after world war i, Germany experienced hyperinflation due to heavy war reparations and a weakened economy.\n13. In 1923, Germany's central bank introduced a new currency, the rentenmark, which was backed by assets and pegged to gold.\n14. This, along with fiscal discipline and international financial support, helped Germany recover from hyperinflation.\n15. In summary, countries recover from hyperinflation by stabilizing their economies through a mix of fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms, working to restore public confidence in their currency and promote long-term financial stability.",

        "input": "Question: Why do we lose unused muscle and not unused fat?\nAnswer: 1. Our bodies lose unused muscle and not unused fat because of how they prioritize energy storage and usage.\n2. Essentially, maintaining muscle is more costly than maintaining fat, so when muscles aren't being used, the body gets rid of them more easily to save energy.\n3. Muscles are constantly active and use a lot of energy, even when we're not exercising.\n4. In contrast, fat is essentially our body's long-term energy storage, and it doesn't require much energy to maintain.\n5. If you don't use your muscles, your body realizes that and thinks, \"hey, I don't necessarily need that extra energy right now, so let's conserve resources!\n6. \" this results in muscle atrophy, or a decrease in muscle mass.\n7. On the other hand, our bodies hold on to fat because it serves as an important energy reserve.\n8. If a situation arises where you need energy quickly (like running from danger or fighting an infection), your body can tap into that fat reserve and convert it into fuel.\n9. Since our bodies are designed to prioritize survival, they'll try to hold on to fat as much as possible.\n10.

Makes very little sense, unless it has something to do with the density?\nAnswer: 1. A rigid airship floats due to buoyancy, which depends on the difference in density between the gas inside the airship and the surrounding air.\n2. Helium and hydrogen are lighter than air, creating enough buoyancy to lift the airship.\n3. A vacuum has no mass but requires a strong, heavy structure to maintain it, which adds weight.\n4.

And why, even after the bag is open, will a clip over the bag keep them fresh whereas leaving them exposed to the same air will make them go stale?\nAnswer: 1. Crisps stay fresh in the bag before it's opened because they are not exposed to regular air; instead, they are sealed in a protective atmosphere containing nitrogen gas.\n2. A summary of the answer could be: \"crisps stay fresh in their bags due to the nitrogen-rich atmosphere and sealing, but become stale in a household environment due to absorbing moisture from the surrounding air.\n3. \"the air we breathe is composed of several gases, including oxygen and moisture.\n4. Oxygen can cause food to oxidize, which leads to spoilage, while moisture can make it go stale.\n5. To prevent this, crisp manufacturers fill the bags with nitrogen, an inert gas that doesn't react with the crisps, keeping them fresh and crunchy.\n6. After opening the bag, the nitrogen is replaced by the surrounding air, and the crisps are exposed to moisture and oxygen.\n7. Clipping the bag helps slow down the rate at which the moisture and oxygen enter the bag, keeping the crisps fresher for a longer period.\n8.

Brine and salt both help to melt ice on roads, but they work differently due to their forms and application methods.\n2. Salt, specifically rock salt, is a solid substance that is spread on roads to lower the freezing point of water.\n3.

It is sprayed onto roads before a snowstorm, creating a protective barrier between the road surface and the snow.\n7. When snow falls on the brine-coated road, it is not able to bond with the surface, making it easier to clear away.\n8.

        "input": "Question: How would a default on us total debt (trillions of $$$) ultimately impact me as an individual?\nAnswer: 1. A default on us total debt would have far-reaching consequences on the country's economy and financial system, ultimately affecting individuals in various ways.\n2. In summary, a default on us debt would negatively impact interest rates, the value of the dollar, public services, and investments, while also potentially causing increased inflation and job losses.\n3. First, let's discuss what a \"default\" means.\n4. When a country like the us borrows money, it does so by issuing government bonds.\n5. These bonds are considered a safe investment because they're backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the us government.\n6. A default would occur if the government failed to make timely payments on the principal or interest of these bonds.\n7. If the us were to default on its debt, financial markets would become unstable.\n8. Investors would view us government bonds as riskier, which would raise interest rates to compensate for that risk.\n9. Higher interest rates would make it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money, slowing down economic growth and potentially causing job losses.\n10. Furthermore, a default would weaken the value of the us dollar in global markets.\n11. The dollar is currently the world's reserve currency, meaning other countries hold large amounts of it to conduct international trade or to store wealth.\n12. If confidence in the us government's ability to pay its debts were to falter, the value of the dollar would drop.\n13. This could lead to increased inflation, as imports would become more expensive, ultimately raising the cost of goods and services for individuals.\n14. Additionally, a default on us debt would affect public services.\n15. If the government were unable to pay its debts, it might have to cut back on spending for services like education, healthcare, and public infrastructure.\n16. This could negatively affect people's quality of life and access to essential services.\n17. Lastly, a default would impact investments.\n18. Many people have some exposure to us government bonds, either directly or indirectly (through pension funds, mutual funds, etc.\n19. ).\n20. In the event of a default, the value of these investments would decline, potentially causing financial losses for individuals.\n21. In conclusion, a default on us total debt would have serious and wide-ranging repercussions on the economy and the daily lives of individuals through higher interest rates, a weaker dollar, reduced public services, and damage to investments.",

Exactly what title says, why is there no way to recoup zelle definitely or wire transfer(maybe? ) but if banks send money to wrong person there are severe penalties for not returning.\nAnswer: 1. The main difference between the two scenarios is that banks have more authority and protection when they make a mistake, while individual transactions through services like zelle are often irreversible and rely on the goodwill of the recipient to return the funds.\n2. When a bank accidentally sends money to the wrong person, there are regulations and legal frameworks in place to help recover the funds.\n3. The recipient is generally obligated to return the money, and if they don't, the bank can take legal action against them.\n4. However, with peer-to-peer (p2p) payment services like zelle, once a transaction is completed, it is usually irreversible.\n5. These services prioritize speed and convenience over protection.\n6. When you send money to the wrong person via zelle, the onus is on you to contact the recipient and request them to return the funds.\n7.

The afghan civil war refers to a continuous state of conflict in Afghanistan that began in 1978 and has involved various phases and factions.\n2. The main factors that led to the rise of the taliban and the role of the Soviet union can be summarized as follows:throughout the 1970s, Afghanistan experienced political instability, which created an environment for conflict.\n3. In 1978, a socialist government, backed by the Soviet union, took control of the country.\n4. This new government faced opposition from afghan citizens who resented the communist policies, leading to the rise of various armed rebel groups called \"mujahideen.\n5. \"in response to this opposition, the Soviet union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to support the communist government.\n6. This sparked a long and brutal war, with the mujahideen receiving financial and military support from the United states and other countries who opposed the Soviet presence.\n7. During the 1980s, Afghanistan became a battleground for cold war politics, with the Soviet union and the United states supporting opposing sides.\n8. The Soviet union eventually withdrew its troops in 1989, but the civil war continued as the mujahideen fought to gain control of the country.\n9. In this power vacuum, a new group called the taliban emerged.\n10. The taliban was a radical islamist movement, consisting mostly of former mujahideen fighters who wanted to establish a strict islamic government.\n11. By 1996, the taliban managed to seize control of most of Afghanistan, establishing their hardline regime.\n12. The Soviet union played a significant role in Afghanistan's recent history, as their support of the communist government and subsequent invasion directly contributed",

        "input": "Question: Why would banks and exchanges need to pause withdrawals if they're in financial trouble?\nAnswer: 1. In simple terms, banks and exchanges need to pause withdrawals when they face financial trouble to maintain their stability and prevent a situation called a \"bank run.\n2. \"a bank run occurs when a large number of people start withdrawing their money from a bank all at once, because they fear the bank might fail or go bankrupt.\n3. This can actually cause the bank to fail, since banks don't hold all their customers' deposited money in cash.\n4. Instead, they lend a portion of it out to others, with the expectation that the loans will be repaid with interest over time.\n5. This is called fractional reserve banking.\n6. When a bank or an exchange faces a financial crisis, pausing withdrawals helps them avoid a bank run and buys them time to stabilize their finances.\n7. It means they can focus on recovering from the crisis in an orderly way, without having to make rushed decisions driven by panic.\n8. The pause also helps protect the customers' money so they don't lose all their savings in case the bank goes bankrupt.\n9. In short, banks and exchanges pause withdrawals during a financial crisis to prevent a destructive chain reaction of withdrawals, and to allow themselves time to recover and protect their customers' funds.",

Ticketmaster's monopoly is difficult to overturn due to a combination of factors including network effects, exclusive contracts, and strong relationships with key industry players.\n2. To start, network effects play a significant role.\n3. In the ticketing industry, a larger user base means more events and more tickets sold, making the platform more attractive to both event organizers and ticket buyers.\n4. As the dominant force in the industry, ticketmaster already has a large and established user base, which in turn attracts new users, further reinforcing their dominant position.\n5. This creates a barrier to entry for competitors, as they struggle to match the same levels of user adoption.\n6. Additionally, ticketmaster has signed exclusive contracts with many venues and event organizers, further consolidating its control.\n7. These deals grant ticketmaster exclusive rights to sell tickets for particular venues or events, making it difficult for rivals to enter the market and compete for the same events.\n8. Finally, relationships with key industry players, such as music and sports promoters, also contribute to ticketmaster's stronghold.\n9.

        "input": "Question: How do they make non-alcoholic beers I am seeing ads for guinness and other nonalcoholic beers. Looked a bit further and saw rum, tequila, whiskey\u2026 that are nonalcoholic and am confused as to how they can create them.\nAnswer: 1. Non-alcoholic beers and spirits are created by removing or reducing the alcohol content while preserving as much of the original taste, aroma, and texture as possible.\n2. It's a tricky and complex process, but let me break it down for you.\n3. One primary method for making non-alcoholic beer is called \"dealcoholization,\" which involves producing regular beer first and then removing the alcohol from it.\n4. There are different techniques to do this, with two common ones being vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis.\n5. In vacuum distillation, beer is heated in a vacuum, which enables the evaporation of alcohol at a lower temperature than boiling.\n6. This way, the beer doesn't lose its essential flavors that are sensitive to high temperatures.\n7. After collecting the alcohol vapor, the beer is blended back together with the non-alcoholic components to achieve the desired alcohol level.\n8. Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, involves forcing beer through a semi-permeable membrane that only allows water and smaller molecules like alcohol to pass through.\n9. The alcohol is then separated from the water, and the remaining solution is mixed back with the concentrated beer, which has retained its flavor.\n10. For non-alcoholic spirits, the process is different as they're typically made by utilizing a combination of botanicals and flavors that mimic the taste and aroma of alcoholic versions without using alcohol itself.\n11. The ingredients can be infused or distilled with water to extract the desired flavors and create a beverage that resembles the original drink but without the alcohol content.\n12. In summary, non-alcoholic beers and spirits are made by removing or reducing their alcohol content while preserving their original taste and aroma, using various dealcoholization techniques or flavor-mimicking strategies.",

If taking supplements / vitamins or drinking tea is supposed to improve your health or immune system, why on these types of products there is a statement saying that the product is not suitable for pregnant and lactating women?\nAnswer: 1. The main reason that some supplements, vitamins, and teas are not recommended for pregnant and lactating women is that certain substances can cross the placenta or be passed through breast milk, potentially affecting the baby's development and health.\n2. While these products may have health benefits for non-pregnant individuals, they may pose risks for pregnant or breastfeeding women and their babies.\n3. Pregnant and lactating women have different nutritional requirements than other adults.\n4. Certain substances might be harmful to the developing baby, even if they're considered safe for non-pregnant adults.\n5. For example, too much vitamin a during pregnancy can lead to birth defects, so pregnant women need to be cautious about their vitamin a intake.\n6. Also, some herbal teas contain herbs that can stimulate contractions or affect hormone levels, potentially causing complications during pregnancy.\n7. Another concern is that supplements and vitamins are not always tightly regulated, meaning that the content and purity of these products can vary.\n8.

You would think the water would take up more volume once in its liquid state\u2026.\nAnswer: 1. The volume of water in the glass remains the same after the ice melts because of a principle called displacement.\n2. When you add ice to a glass, the ice takes up space and displaces an equal volume of water.\n3. In other words, the ice is pushing the water out of its way to make room for itself.\n4. Ice is actually less dense than water, meaning that it takes up slightly more space than an equivalent mass of water.\n5. When ice melts, it contracts and turns into water, taking up less space.\n6. However, the decrease in volume from ice to water is equal to the amount of water it initially displaced.\n7. This is because as the ice melts and its volume decreases, the water it displaced occupies the space that was previously taken by the ice.\n8. In summary, the volume of water in the glass stays the same after the ice has melted because the ice displaces an equal volume of water, and this displaced water takes up the space left by the melting ice.",

Ptolemy studied and learned from the world and travels of Anaximander and Hecataeus centuries earlier. To Greek philosophers in the BCE and then AD periods, it can be argued that 'regions' were continents and city-states distanced from the origin point of the traveler: their home, with home, often placed as the literal 'center of the Earth'.Sources: https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/here-be-dragons/ https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hecataeus-of-miletus"

The main reason why civilizations such as the pre dorset, thule, and inuit did not migrate south despite their harsh and extreme environments can be attributed to adaptation and the availability of resources in the arctic region.\n2. Over time, these civilizations became well-adapted to their cold environments, developing techniques and tools to survive the harsh conditions.\n3. For example, they built efficient, insulated homes\u2014such as igloos\u2014made from materials found in the arctic, like snow and ice.\n4. Their clothing, which was made from animal skins, provided excellent insulation as well.\n5. Moreover, the arctic region offered a unique set of resources that allowed these civilizations to thrive.\n6. These included whales, seals, walruses, and fish, which were abundant in the region.\n7. Hunting these animals not only provided food but also materials for clothing, tools, and shelter.\n8. This is similar to how some desert-dwelling civilizations were able to sustain themselves, despite their seemingly inhospitable environment.\n9. It's also important to note that the concept of moving towards a more favorable climate isn't always advantageous in practice.\n10. Migrating a whole civilization requires a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources.\n11. In addition, moving south could lead to competition with other groups for food and territory, increasing the likelihood of conflicts.\n12. In summary, while the arctic environments these civilizations inhabited were harsh, their adaptations and access to unique resources allowed them to live successfully in those areas.\n13.

        "input": "Question: Why didn\u2019t the United states just drop a nuclear bomb right outside of Japan (in the ocean) to show the Japanese what could be done to them if they did not surrender instead of immediately killing civilians?\nAnswer: 1. The United states' decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki instead of demonstrating their power through a non-combative display can be attributed to a combination of factors such as strategic considerations, urgency, and uncertainties about the bomb's effectiveness.\n2. To begin with, let's consider the strategic perspective.\n3. During world war ii, the United states and its allies sought to force Japan to surrender and end the war as quickly as possible.\n4. Demonstrating the destructive power of a nuclear bomb by detonating it in the ocean might not have been as persuasive or as immediate in securing Japan's surrender as directly targeting cities that were crucial to Japan's military and industrial infrastructure.\n5. Think of it this way: if you want to stop someone from doing something, causing direct harm may be more effective and immediate than simply demonstrating your ability to harm them.\n6. The decision-makers at the time believed that the swift and devastating bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would lead to Japan's surrender and save lives in the long run by preventing a drawn-out invasion of the Japanese mainland, which could have resulted in a much higher death toll for both sides.\n7. Another reason was the urgency of the situation.\n8. In the summer of 1945, the allies were preparing for a land invasion of Japan, which was expected to cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives.\n9. Delaying the use of the atomic bombs may have significantly prolonged the conflict and escalated the human cost.\n10. It's also important to remember that the Soviet union was about to join the war against Japan, which added pressure on the us to act decisively and attempt to bring about a quick end to the war.\n11. Furthermore, at the time the bombs were dropped, there had been only two successful tests of nuclear weapons.\n12. Given the limited information available about the bomb's effectiveness, as well as the possibility that it might have failed or have been less destructive than anticipated, the United states chose to use the bomb for maximum impact.\n13. An unsuccessful demonstration, or one that was less impactful than the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, could have led Japan to believe that the us was bluffing, potentially prolonging the war.\n14. It is also crucial to note that communication channels between the us and Japan during wartime were limited and unreliable.\n15. Arranging a demonstration for Japan's leadership could have proven difficult logistically and might not have carried the desired effect, even if the bomb were shown to be as powerful in the demonstration as in the actual attacks.\n16. Lastly, the moral and ethical aspects of the bombings were not at the forefront of strategic thinking at the time.\n17. The concept of total war, in which civilian and military resources were considered legitimate targets, was prevalent during world war ii.\n18. In this context, the bombings were not seen as drastically different from other targeting strategies used throughout the war, such as the large-scale firebombing of Japanese cities prior to the use of the atomic bombs.\n19. In summary, the United states chose to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki rather than demonstrating their power at sea because they believed it would be a more effective and immediate means to force Japan's surrender, saving lives in the long run by preventing a protracted land invasion.\n20. Additionally, the urgency of the situation, uncertainties surrounding the bomb's effectiveness, and logistical and communication challenges made the direct use of the bombs a more viable option at the time.",

        "input": "Question: Who is the observer? If I am sitting on a rock in space and an alien on an asteroid passes me by super fast, does the alien age slower than me? I am confused because from the alien\u2019s point of view I am moving super fast. So who ages slower like in ender\u2019s game?\nAnswer: 1. In the context of your question, the observer refers to the person or being that is making the observations or measurements.\n2. In this case, there are two observers: you sitting on the rock and the alien on the asteroid.\n3. The phenomenon you're referring to is called \"time dilation,\" which is a result of einstein's theory of relativity.\n4. Time dilation occurs when two objects are moving relative to one another at very high speeds, causing the time experienced by one observer to pass more slowly than the time experienced by another observer.\n5. To understand this better, let's think about a simpler example.\n6. Imagine you have a light clock, which is essentially two mirrors facing each other with light bouncing back and forth between them.\n7. Each time the light bounces off a mirror, it counts as one \"tick\" of time.\n8. Now, let's say you're holding this light clock while sitting on the rock, and the alien has an identical light clock on the asteroid.\n9. From your point of view, the light in your clock is bouncing straight up and down between the mirrors.\n10. However, from the alien's point of view, since they're moving at a high speed relative to you, the light in your clock has to travel further by going diagonally, as it moves up and down between the mirrors while also moving sideways due to your relative motion.\n11. Because the speed of light is constant, this means that more time passes for the alien's clock to complete one \"tick\" than for your clock.\n12. This is time dilation, and it means that from the alien's perspective, your clock - and therefore, you - is aging more slowly.\n13. However, from your perspective, it's the alien's clock that's moving diagonally and taking longer to complete a tick, so the alien would be aging more slowly.\n14. In other words, both observers would see the other one's clock running slower.\n15. This is called the \"twin paradox,\" and it's resolved when something causes the symmetry between the two observers to break, like the alien turning around to come back to you.\n16. At that point, you'll be able to compare the two clocks directly, and the one that experienced more acceleration will have aged less.\n17. In summary, the observer refers to the person or being making the observations.\n18. Time dilation occurs when two objects are moving at high speeds relative to one another, causing",

        "input": "Question: When and how did we historically land on 18 as the age of adulthood? Pretty much the title. It seems 18 is universally recognized as the age of adulthood and i'm wondering why such a specific number. Why not 20 for example?\nAnswer: 1. The concept of 18 as the age of adulthood has its roots in various historical, social, and cultural factors, but it is not universally recognized across all cultures and societies.\n2. The number 18 became more prevalent as the age of adulthood mainly during the 20th century, primarily in western countries, and its adoption can be attributed to several contributing factors.\n3. One major reason for choosing 18 as the age of adulthood is linked to education.\n4. In many western countries, compulsory education typically ends around age 18, marking the point when young people often transition from full-time education to either further education, employment, or other pursuits.\n5. This transition is frequently viewed as a marker of increased autonomy and responsibility, which aligns with the idea of adulthood.\n6. Another reason is military service.\n7. In the past, conscription for military service played a significant role in determining the age of adulthood.\n8. For example, during world war I and ii, many countries drafted young men aged 18 or older for service, associating the age of 18 with maturity and responsibility.\n9. Historically, the legal age of adulthood varied depending on different factors such as gender, civil rights, property ownership, and rights to vote.\n10. In some cases, the age of maturity was set at 21, but the push to lower the voting age during the vietnam war in the United states eventually led to a more widespread adoption of 18 as the age of adulthood.\n11. Lastly, biological factors also play a role, as the late teens are typically when individuals complete the majority of their physical and cognitive development, signifying a transition to adulthood.\n12. In summary, the adoption of 18 as the age of adulthood is a result of various historical, social, cultural, and biological factors, mainly in western societies, but it's not a universally recognized standard across all cultures.",

        "input": "Question: How are devices like smattphones given unique ids (imei numbers, mac addresses) during the manufacturing process?\nAnswer: 1. In simple terms, devices like smartphones are given unique ids, such as imei numbers and mac addresses, during the manufacturing process by assigning a unique sequence of numbers and/or letters to each device.\n2. These identifiers are important as they help in identifying and distinguishing one device from another, enabling communication between devices, and even securing devices against theft or misuse.\n3. Let's break down the concept of imei numbers and mac addresses to understand how they work and how they are assigned during manufacturing.\n4. Imei (international mobile equipment identity) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to each mobile phone or smartphone.\n5. It is primarily used for identifying the device and helps in preventing theft, fraud, and unauthorized use.\n6. To understand how smartphones are given unique imei numbers, we need to first understand the structure of these numbers.\n7. An imei number consists of four parts:1.\n8. Type allocation code (tac): this is an 8-digit code that represents the manufacturer and the specific model of the device.\n9. 2.\n10. Serial number: this is a 6-digit unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer to each device in a model series.\n11. 3.\n12. Luhn check digit: this is a single-digit number calculated using the luhn algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the typed imei number.\n13. 4.\n14. Software version number (svn): this is an optional 2-digit number representing the software version of the device.\n15. When a smartphone is manufactured, the manufacturer assigns a unique tac for the specific model of the device.\n16. Within the production of that model, each individual device is then given a unique serial number.\n17. This process can be done manually or automatically through a computer system to ensure no repetitions.\n18. The luhn check digit is calculated and added to the imei, and if applicable, the software version number is appended.\n19. This complete 15-digit imei is stored within the device's firmware and is usually printed on a label under the battery or the device's packaging.\n20. Mac (media access control) address, on the other hand, is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal identifier assigned to a device's network interface controller (nic).\n21. It is primarily used for communication between devices over a network, such as WI-FI or bluetooth.\n22. A mac address consists of two parts:1.\n23. Organizationally unique identifier (oui): this is a 6-digit identifier assigned by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) to a specific manufacturer.\n24. 2.\n25. Device identifier: this is a 6-digit unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer to each device.\n26. In order to assign unique mac addresses to smartphones, manufacturers first obtain an oui from the ieee, which is uniquely assigned to them.\n27. Then, during the manufacturing process, each device's network interface is assigned a unique device identifier by the manufacturer.\n28. Similar to the imei assignment process, this can be done manually or automatically through computer systems.\n29. The oui and device identifier are combined to form the complete 12-digit mac address, which is stored within the device's network interface card.\n30. Both imei numbers and mac addresses are assigned during the manufacturing process to ensure that each device has a unique identifier.\n31. This assignment makes it easier to track, manage, and communicate with devices in various networking and communication scenarios.",

        "input": "Question: How do detergents and soaps work differently? Aren't both of them designed to remove dirt?\nAnswer: 1. Yes, both detergents and soaps are designed to remove dirt, but they work differently due to their chemical composition and how they interact with water and dirt particles.\n2. Soaps are made from natural materials, like animal fats or plant oils, combined with an alkaline substance, like sodium hydroxide (lye).\n3. They work by reducing water's surface tension.\n4. In simpler terms, soap molecules have one end that likes water (hydrophilic) and another end that dislikes water but likes oil and grease (hydrophobic).\n5. When soap and water mix, the hydrophobic ends surround the dirt and grease, forming tiny droplets called micelles.\n6. These micelles get suspended in water and can be easily rinsed away.\n7. Detergents, on the other hand, are synthetic (man-made) and work in a similar way but with some differences.\n8. They also have hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends, but they can work effectively in a broader range of water types, including hard water containing minerals like calcium or magnesium.\n9. Hard water can make soap less effective since minerals in it can bind with soap molecules, resulting in a sticky residue.\n10.

A propane-powered cool box, also known as an absorption refrigerator, uses a unique process to cool down without relying on a compressor like a traditional refrigerator.\n2. Despite burning gas and generating heat, the heat actually helps drive the cooling process.\n3. The main idea behind absorption refrigeration is the use of a heat source, in this case, propane, to separate a refrigerant, usually ammonia, from a solution, typically water.\n4. When propane burns, it heats a mixture of water and ammonia.\n5. The heat causes the ammonia to evaporate and separate from the water, traveling in a gas form to another chamber.\n6. There, the ammonia gas releases its heat and condenses back into a liquid, removing warmth from the inside of the refrigerator.\n7. As the liquid ammonia flows back, it mixes with the water again, repeating the cycle.\n8. In essence, the heat generated by the propane is used to create a cooling effect through a continuous cycle of evaporation and condensation driven by the unique properties of ammonia and its interaction with water.",

With the half life of the radioactive metals used in the fuel rods being thousands of years, the fuel used in reacors, I would think, should last for similar amounts of time. How come nuclear plants go through large ammount of spent fuel that then has to be stored?\nAnswer: 1. Nuclear fuel gets spent relatively quickly because it's not the half-life of the radioactive metals that determines the fuel's usability, but rather the concentration of fissile isotopes like uranium-235.\n2. These isotopes are responsible for sustaining the chain reaction to generate energy.\n3. When a nuclear reactor is operating, uranium-235 in the fuel rods undergoes fission, producing energy and splitting into smaller elements called fission products.\n4. As the reaction continues, more uranium-235 gets used up, and the concentration of fission products increases.\n5. Eventually, there's not enough uranium-235 left to sustain a chain reaction, and the fuel becomes \"spent.\n6. \"it's like using a box of matches where most matches don't burn well.\n7.

        "input": "Question: Why does bar soap leave your hands feeling grippy as opposed to liquid soap feeling moist? One starts as a solid and one starts as a liquid but they\u2019re both soap right? Why do your hands feel so much different between the two?\nAnswer: 1. The primary reason bar soap leaves your hands feeling grippy, while liquid soap leaves them feeling moist, is due to the different ingredients and formulation processes used in making these types of soap.\n2. In essence, both bar and liquid soaps are made using a similar process called saponification, which involves combining fats or oils with an alkali (like sodium or potassium hydroxide).\n3. However, the specific ingredients and proportions used in the process vary between the two types of soap, resulting in distinct properties and textures.\n4. Bar soap typically contains higher percentages of fatty acids derived from oils such as coconut, palm, or tallow, which make the soap more solid and harder.\n5. It also contains glycerin, a byproduct of the saponification process that provides moisturizing properties.\n6. However, because of its solid form and the presence of insoluble compounds (such as salts or minerals), bar soap can have a more abrasive texture and leave behind a thin film after rinsing.\n7. This film, combined with the \"squeaky-clean\" feeling after removing oils and dirt, can result in the grippy sensation on your hands.\n8. On the other hand, liquid soap has a higher water content, which gives it a smoother and more fluid texture.\n9. The saponification process for liquid soap typically involves using potassium hydroxide instead of sodium hydroxide, resulting in softer soaps that dissolve more readily in water.\n10. Additionally, liquid soaps often contain extra moisturizing agents, such as glycols or alcohols, that help maintain the feeling of moisture after use.\n11. To envision the difference, you can think of bar soap as a dry eraser that \"scrubs\" the dirt away, leaving your hands dry and grippy, whereas liquid soap can be likened to a wet sponge that gently cleans your hands and leaves them feeling hydrated and moist.\n12. In summary, the primary difference in how your hands feel after using bar soap and liquid soap lies in their unique formulation, with bar soap containing higher percentages of fatty acids and insoluble compounds, and liquid soap incorporating more water and moisturizing agents, giving each of them distinct cleaning and sensory",

It fully makes sense that it\u2019s complicated to get the texture right, but why have I never been able to find a product that tastes like real bacon, for example? What makes it more than just the right combination of chemicals for a bacon flavour?\nAnswer: 1. The difficulty in making vegetarian/vegan meat replacement foods taste like real meat comes from the complex combination of flavors, textures, and chemical reactions that occur in meat during the cooking process.\n2. While it might be possible to recreate some aspects of the flavor, capturing the full experience of consuming meat is a challenging task.\n3. Meat flavor comes from a mix of compounds that are either naturally present in the meat or created during the cooking process.\n4. One key contributor to the flavor is the maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars.\n5. This reaction creates a golden-brown crust on the surface of the meat and generates hundreds of volatile compounds, giving the meat its distinct flavor and aroma.\n6. Furthermore, fats and connective tissues in the meat play important roles in creating a rich, mouth-watering taste.\n7. Vegan and vegetarian meat alternatives are typically made from plant-based proteins like soy, wheat, and peas, which have their own distinct flavors and textures.\n8. They often need to be combined and processed in a way that mimics the structure and mouthfeel of real meat, which can be a challenge in itself.\n9. As for the flavor, food scientists and chefs have made progress in mimicking the taste of meat by using various combinations of spices, flavorings, and ingredients.\n10. For example, they might use liquid smoke, paprika, or nutritional yeast to mimic the smoky, savory, and \"umami\" flavors often associated with real meat.\n11. However, recreating the exact complex mix of flavors found in meat is still a work in progress.\n12. In summary, replicating the taste of real meat in vegetarian/vegan alternatives is difficult due to the complex combination of flavors and chemical reactions that occur in meat during cooking.\n13.

The tongue can detect five basic tastes, but flavor is more than just taste.\n2. Flavor is a combination of taste, aroma, texture, and even temperature.\n3. While we may be able to combine the five basic tastes to imitate certain flavors, it's difficult to reproduce every flavor in this way because our perception of flavor also relies heavily on our sense of smell.\n4. When we eat, the aroma molecules from food travel to our olfactory receptors (located in the nose), which play a significant role in how we perceive flavor.\n5. There are thousands of different aroma molecules, and many of these can't be recreated solely through the combination of the basic tastes.\n6. Additionally, texture contributes to the overall experience of a flavor, and mixing sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami elements cannot replicate this aspect.\n7.

        "input": "Question: Why do public companies worry about their stock price? I feel like every time someone explains why stock prices matter to companies, they talk about some vague sense of future funding and attracting new talent, but i'm having trouble understanding why the price of stocks, which are already in the hands of the \"public\" (at least most of them are I assume? ) matter so much that companies feel the need to lay off huge chunks of their workforce. Am I missing or understating the fundamental role that stock prices play in future operations?\nAnswer: 1. In essence, public companies worry about their stock price because it reflects the overall market perception of their value and can impact their ability to raise capital, attract talent, and conduct business transactions.\n2. Firstly, a public company's stock price represents the market's perception of the company's value, which takes into account factors like financial performance, growth potential, and market conditions.\n3. A higher stock price indicates that investors have a positive outlook on the company, and they believe it has high growth potential.\n4. Conversely, a declining stock price may signal that investors have concerns about the company's performance or prospects.\n5. The stock price can have a direct impact on a company's ability to raise capital.\n6. Higher stock prices make it easier for companies to issue new shares (called equity financing) to raise money.\n7. Since the company's shares are more valuable, they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount of capital.\n8. However, if the stock price is low, companies may need to issue more shares, which dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders and can lead to further declines in stock price.\n9. Attracting and retaining talent is also related to the stock price.\n10. Competitive compensation packages often include stock options, which are the opportunity to buy company shares at a preset price.\n11. If the stock price rises in the future, the options become more valuable, as individuals can buy the shares at the lower preset price and then potentially sell them for a higher market price.\n12. If the stock price is low or declining, these options become less attractive, making it harder to hire and retain top talent.\n13. Finally, stock price matters in business transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions.\n14. If a company wants to acquire or merge with another company, they may use their shares as a form of payment.\n15. If their stock price is high, those shares are more valuable, making it more attractive for the target company to accept the deal.\n16. In summary, stock prices are crucial for public companies as they reflect investor confidence, determine the ease of raising capital, help attract and retain talent, and influence business transactions.\n17. Companies may feel the need to make significant changes, like laying off employees or restructuring, to improve their financial performance and regain investor confidence, ultimately aiming to increase the stock price.",

G. , Google lost $100b after its AI made a factual error in a demo.\nAnswer: 1. When a publicly traded company loses billions of dollars in one day, it typically refers to a decrease in the company's market value or stock price, not an actual loss of cash.\n2. The market value is determined by multiplying the stock price by the number of outstanding shares.\n3. Factors such as negative news, poor financial results, or industry trends can cause investors to sell their shares, leading to a drop in the stock price and a decreased market value.\n4. For example, if Google's artificial intelligence (ai) made a factual error during a demo causing investors to question the technology's reliability, they might sell their shares.\n5. This would cause the stock price to drop and the company's market value to decline, even though there is no direct loss of money.\n6. The immediate impact of the loss in market value might not require layoffs or project cancellations within the company, especially if it is a temporary reaction to an isolated event.\n7. However, if the decline in market value persists or worsens, it may affect the company's ability to raise funds through issuing new shares, securing loans, or investing in new projects.\n8.

Nuclear fusion is a process where light atomic nuclei, like hydrogen, combine to form heavier nuclei, such as helium, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process.\n2. This is different from nuclear fission, which involves splitting heavy nuclei like uranium.\n3. Think of fusion like building a sandcastle.\n4.

The sun's energy, for example, comes from nuclear fusion occurring at its core.\n6. Now, let's talk about break-even fusion.\n7. The challenge in achieving nuclear fusion on earth is that it requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to ignite the reaction, like 15 million degrees celsius (27 million degrees fahrenheit).\n8.

How have companies such as vanguard and blackrock or nestle, pepsi, coke, grown to be as big as they are with these 2 acts in place. It should prohibit them from growing to these sizes but they only seem to be getting bigger.\nAnswer: 1. The sherman antitrust act of 1890 and the clayton antitrust act of 1914 were designed to prevent monopolies and protect competition in the market.\n2. The reason they may seem ineffective against modern companies like vanguard, blackrock, nestle, pepsi, and coke is that these businesses have grown through legal means, avoiding anti-competitive practices that the acts target.\n3. These companies strategically use mergers and acquisitions to expand while maintaining compliance with regulations.\n4. Additionally, as the global economy has evolved, it's become harder to apply the antiquated laws to modern business practices.\n5. Furthermore, interpretation and enforcement of these acts can greatly depend on government priorities and agency resources, allowing some large companies to continue growing without facing significant antitrust challenges.",

Mixing bleach with other chemicals can produce toxic gases, making it dangerous.\n2. For example, when bleach is combined with ammonia, it releases a toxic gas called chloramine.\n3. This gas can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, and other health issues.\n4. Similarly, when bleach mixes with vinegar, it releases chlorine gas, which can be harmful if inhaled.\n5. These reactions are dangerous because the gases produced are toxic and can build up in the surrounding air, posing a risk to people nearby.\n6.

[Incomplete] Reasons: The answer is factually correct but presents incomplete information here as it does not establish how, historically, individuals were considered 'vulnerable'. Further exposition on economic, social, or cultural reasons for 'vulnerability' would complete this line of the answer. For example, in Ancient Rome and Greece, slaves were widespread and vital for the foundations of the economy. They were defined by their utility, including as assistants to even the lowest landowning class of tenant farmers. Slaves were 'vulnerable' to the extent of the economic fortunes of their masters who were often skilled laborers needing assistance in their craft (whereas the majority of slaves were unskilled and easily traded between industries such as mining and construction, see Jones, A. H. M. *Slavery in the Ancient World*. The Economic History Review 9, no. 2 (1956): 185\u201399.

Converesly, 'vulnerability' was not exclusively defined by the economic stability of the habitat of slaves in ancient Rome, as the philosopher Seneca (early first century AD.) accounts - both in his writings 'On Clemency' and 'Letters from a Stoic' - that slaves trafficked into domestic servitude did have a better quality of life than those subjected to work the mines or fields, but more often experienced physical and sexual abuse, especially at important domestic events such as banquets where the slaves were more 'visible' and expected to perform immaculately for their masters (see: Senneca, *Letters from a Stoic*, 47.); (https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/nero-man-behind-myth/slavery-ancient-rome).\n3.

When I drop my phone, shouldn't the force of impact be transferred to the phone itself since the case is in contact with the phone? Also how can the tempered glass protect my screen from cracks if its just a piece of plastic placed on top of my screen?\nAnswer: 1. Phone covers and tempered glass protect your phone by absorbing and distributing the force of impact when your phone is dropped.\n2. While it's true that the case is in contact with your phone, the materials used in these protective accessories are designed to handle the shock and minimize the damage that reaches your device.\n3. To explain this, imagine jumping onto a soft mattress versus jumping onto a concrete floor.\n4. The mattress, being soft and compressible, would absorb the impact of your jump, while the hard concrete wouldn't absorb much of the impact, leading to potential injuries.\n5. Similarly, phone covers and tempered glass work as a cushion for your device.\n6. Phone covers are typically made of silicone, rubber, or a combination of materials that are designed to be flexible and shock-absorbent.\n7. When your phone hits the ground, the cover spreads out the force by deforming and bouncing back into shape, reducing the force that reaches the phone itself.\n8. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is designed to be strong and resistant to scratches.\n9. It's made by a process of heating and cooling the glass, making it much stronger than regular glass.\n10.

        "input": "Question: What are the differences between methamphetamine and just amphetamines, like adderall? I am currently being told they're completely different, even though they're both amphetamines with a similar side effect profile and potential for abuse. So whats the difference?\nAnswer: 1. The main difference between methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall lies in their chemical structure, potency, and effects on the body.\n2. Both substances are stimulants that affect the central nervous system, but their specific properties and uses can vary due to these differences.\n3. Methamphetamine, commonly known as meth, is a highly potent and illegal drug.\n4. Its chemical structure is unique because it has an extra methyl group (ch3) attached to it.\n5. This small change makes methamphetamine more potent than regular amphetamines, as it allows the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily.\n6. This results in stronger and longer-lasting effects on the user.\n7. Amphetamines, like those found in adderall, are a class of drugs often used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and narcolepsy.\n8. Adderall is a combination of amphetamine salts and is available through prescription.\n9. Although it has a similar effect on the central nervous system as methamphetamine, it is less potent and generally considered safer when used according to a doctor's prescription.\n10. Think of the relationship between methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall as similar to the difference between a strong cup of coffee and an espresso shot.\n11. Both contain caffeine and have stimulating effects, but the espresso is much more concentrated and potent.\n12. In summary, while both methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall are related stimulants, they differ in their chemical structure, potency, and uses.\n13. Methamphetamine is a more powerful and dangerous substance, while adderall is a prescription medication used to treat specific medical conditions and is considered safer when used as directed.",

Argentina has 100% inflation mainly due to a combination of economic problems, such as a persistent budget deficit, high public debt, and a dependence on printing money.\n2. Inflation occurs when there's a general rise in the prices of goods and services in an economy, which then leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of its currency.\n3. One of the main reasons behind Argentina's inflation is the government's budget deficit.\n4. When the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it has to find ways to finance this difference.\n5. One way is to borrow money by issuing bonds, but when lenders become reluctant to buy them, the government might resort to printing more money.\n6. This increases the total amount of money circulating in the economy, which in turn pushes up prices and creates inflation.\n7. Besides, Argentina has a high level of public debt, and its government has defaulted on its debts multiple times throughout history.\n8. This leads to a lack of trust from international investors, who may demand higher interest rates before lending, making it even more difficult for the country to borrow and repay its debts.\n9. Another factor contributing to Argentina's inflation is its dependence on exporting commodities, such as soybeans and beef, for its revenue.\n10. Fluctuations in the prices of these commodities, due to changing global demand, can significantly impact Argentina's economy.\n11. When commodity prices are low or the demand declines, Argentina may face a reduction in revenue, causing the government to resort back to printing more money and further fueling inflation.\n12.

        "input": "Question: Why does heat \"build up\" when eating some spicy foods, and in others they have a consistent spicyness?\nAnswer: 1. Heat build-up in spicy foods is due to the presence of compounds called capsaicinoids, which are responsible for the sensation of spiciness.\n2. The way these compounds interact with our taste buds and sensory receptors determines whether the heat builds up or stays consistent.\n3. When you eat spicy foods, capsaicinoids activate a protein called trpv1 on the sensory receptors in your mouth and tongue.\n4. This protein responds to high temperatures and pain, sending signals to your brain that you're experiencing heat or discomfort.\n5. The more capsaicinoids present in the food, the stronger the sensation of spiciness.\n6. Some spicy foods cause heat build-up because the capsaicinoids take a while to bind to the trpv1 receptors, allowing the heat to accumulate gradually.\n7. Also, our saliva and the process of digestion can release more of these compounds as we eat, making the spiciness seem to grow over time.\n8. An example of this is spicy curry, where the heat intensifies as you continue to eat.\n9. On the other hand, some spicy foods have a consistent heat level due to the capsaicinoids binding quickly to the trpv1 receptors, providing an immediate and constant sensation of spiciness.\n10. An example is hot sauce, which has a more stable heat level when consumed.\n11. These factors contribute to the different experiences of spiciness in various foods.",

An electron is a fundamental particle, meaning it's not made up of smaller particles.\n2. The \"material\" composition of electrons and other fundamental particles is not like regular matter that's made of atoms.\n3. Instead, these particles are described by their properties, like mass and charge.\n4.

        "input": "Question: Why are our brains not with the other vital organs? They're all in the same part of the body, except the brain. Did the other organs all move together into their location, how did the brain get left out?\nAnswer: 1. The main reason why the brain is located separately from other vital organs is due to its unique and vital functions, as well as specialized protection.\n2. Let's break down the concept step-by-step:1.\n3. Function: the brain is the control center of the entire body.\n4. It processes information, makes decisions, and sends signals to other organs and muscles.\n5. Because of its crucial role, the brain needs to be in a position to easily and quickly communicate with the rest of the body.\n6. The head is an ideal location for this as it is at the top of the spinal cord, which acts as a communication highway between the brain and the rest of the body.\n7. 2.\n8. Protection: the brain is extremely delicate and sensitive, and it needs extra protection that other organs don't require.\n9. To ensure its safety, the brain is encased within the skull, which is a strong and protective bone structure.\n10. Additionally, the brain is also cushioned by cerebrospinal fluid, which helps protect it from injury by absorbing shocks and providing a stable environment.\n11. In contrast, most of the other vital organs are located in the torso, where they are protected by the ribcage and encased within a compact space.\n12.

The credit card competition act aims to foster fair competition among credit card issuers by preventing them from colluding to set high fees merchants pay for card transactions.\n2. These fees, also known as interchange fees, partially fund credit card rewards programs.\n3. If the act leads to lower fees, credit card companies may have less revenue to fund rewards.\n4.

This close relationship between viruses and host cells makes it difficult to develop antiviral drugs that can target the virus without harming the host cell.\n6. On the other hand, bacteria and fungi are more complex organisms with their own cellular machinery for reproduction and metabolism.\n7. This makes it easier to develop antibiotics and antifungals that can specifically target the processes unique to bacteria and fungi, without affecting human cells.\n8. Another challenge in developing antiviral drugs is the high mutation rate of viruses.\n9. They can quickly evolve and develop resistance to antiviral drugs, making it difficult to create long-lasting treatments.\n10. In contrast, bacteria and fungi evolve at a slower rate, allowing antibiotics and antifungals to remain effective for longer periods.\n11. In summary, antivirals are less commonly used to treat viral infections because viruses have a simpler structure and a closer relationship with host cells, making it harder to develop drugs that can effectively target them without harming the host.\n12.

Warm water, baking soda, and aluminum create a chemical reaction that removes tarnish from metals like silver and copper, making them shiny.\n2. The tarnish is a thin layer of metal oxide, usually caused by exposure to air and moisture.\n3. In this process, the metal oxide on the tarnished object reacts with the aluminum, causing the metal oxide to transfer from the tarnished object to the aluminum, leaving the object shiny.\n4. This process is called 'electrochemical reduction' and works best with metals like silver, copper, and brass.\n5. It doesn't work with all metals because not every metal forms oxide layers that can be removed through this particular chemical reaction.",

I was at a loss.\nAnswer: 1. Dinosaur skeletons are more commonly found than those of our ancestors like lucy because dinosaurs lived for a much longer time, across a wider range of environments, and there were many different species of them.\n2. On the other hand, our ancestors were fewer in number, from just a few species, and mostly lived in limited geographical areas.\n3. Fossils form under specific conditions, which involve the quick burial of remains in sediment, like mud or sand, that eventually hardens into rock.\n4. These conditions were more common in the environments where dinosaurs lived, such as riverbanks and lakes, increasing their chances of becoming fossils.\n5. In contrast, our ancestors lived in areas where these ideal conditions for fossilization were relatively rare.\n6. Additionally, our ancestors had a smaller overall population than dinosaurs, making it less likely for their remains to be preserved.\n7. In summary, the reason we find more dinosaur fossils than those of our ancestors is due to the longer timespan, greater number, and variety of dinosaur species, as well as the increased likelihood of their remains encountering the right conditions for fossilization.",

        "input": "Question: How do we get energy from both fusion and fission. I heard recently a large hurdle to figuring out fusion energy was overcome and while there are still other challenges to face it\u2019s possible that we could one day see fusion reactors.\nAnswer: 1. In both fusion and fission, energy is released due to the conversion of mass into energy, as described by einstein's famous equation e=mc^2.\n2. Fusion combines lighter elements to form heavier ones, while fission breaks down heavy elements into lighter ones.\n3. Fusion energy involves combining two small atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes (for example, deuterium and tritium), at tremendously high temperatures and pressure to form a heavier nucleus, like helium.\n4. This process releases excess energy in the form of heat and light.\n5. The sun, for example, generates energy through nuclear fusion.\n6. Creating sustainable fusion on earth is a challenge because of the extreme conditions needed for fusion reactions to occur, but recent breakthroughs have shown progress towards achieving this goal.\n7. Fission energy, on the other hand, involves breaking down heavy atomic nuclei, like uranium-235, into smaller nuclei.\n8. This is usually achieved by bombarding the heavy nucleus with a neutron, which causes it to split into two smaller nuclei and release more neutrons along with significant amounts of energy.\n9. This process is currently used in nuclear reactors to produce electricity.\n10. Theoretically, it is possible to split heavier elements into lighter ones and then fuse them back into heavier ones, but this would not be practical due to the energy required to initiate fusion.\n11. The energy needed for fusion is typically higher than that obtained from fission, and the overall process would consume rather than generate energy.",

        "input": "Question: How can ceos/officers/execs/etc of a company buy their own stock it not be insider trading? Subject says it all. How can, say, a top executive, even the CEO be allowed to purchase their own company's stock when they most likely have knowledge of the company's overall performance, etc and it not be considered insider trading? I assume they would have insight into company announcements, financials, etc that, when released to the public, could cause the stock price to rise (or vice versa, fall) - how are they allowed to buy/sell stock at all?\nAnswer: 1. In a nutshell, executives and insiders can buy and sell their own company's stock, but they must follow strict rules and regulations to prevent insider trading.\n2. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a company's stocks or securities using non-public, material information that can influence the stock price.\n3. This gives insiders an unfair advantage over ordinary investors and undermines trust in the financial markets.\n4. To prevent this, there are rules and regulations governing when and how insiders can trade their company's stock.\n5. Firstly, insiders must report all their trades to the u.\n6. S.\n7. Securities and exchange commission (sec) within a specified time frame, usually two business days.\n8. This ensures that their trades are disclosed to the public, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on the insider's actions.\n9. This also helps the sec monitor and detect any potential insider trading.\n10. Secondly, insiders must abide by specific trading schedules or \"trading windows.\n11. \" these are periods during which they are allowed to buy or sell their company's stock.\n12. These windows typically open after the announcement of quarterly earnings or other significant financial reports, when the material information is already public.\n13. This helps to level the playing field, as insiders will not have access to non-public information that could influence their trading decisions during these periods.\n14. Thirdly, insiders can use something called a \"10b5-1 plan\" to trade their company's stock without violating insider trading laws.\n15. A 10b5-1 plan is a pre-determined trading plan that outlines when and how much stock the insider plans to buy or sell.\n16. This plan must be established when the insider does not have any material non-public information and must be followed strictly.\n17. By committing to a trading plan in advance, the insider demonstrates that their trades are not based on non-public information, and thus avoids any accusations of insider trading.\n18. Additionally, some companies implement \"blackout periods\" around major announcements, during which employees and insiders are prohibited from trading company stocks.\n19. This further reduces the risk of insider trading by limiting the window in which an insider can take advantage of non-public information.\n20. In conclusion, while company executives and insiders have access to sensitive information, they are allowed to buy and sell their company's stock as long as they follow strict rules and regulations to ensure a level playing field for all investors.\n21. These rules include timely reporting of trades, adhering to trading windows, using pre-determined 10b5-1 plans, and observing company-imposed blackout periods.",

By blocking adenosine, caffeine essentially tricks your brain into thinking you're more awake than you actually are.\n4. The main reason energy drinks are considered \"bad\" is that they often contain high levels of caffeine and sugar, as well as other stimulants like taurine and guarana.\n5. This combination can lead to a sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be dangerous for some individuals, particularly those with pre-existing heart conditions or high blood pressure.\n6. In extreme cases, excessive consumption of energy drinks has been linked to heart problems and even death.\n7. Additionally, the high sugar content in energy drinks contributes to weight gain and dental issues, while the stimulating effects of caffeine can lead to sleep disruption, anxiety, and even addiction.\n8. While energy drinks may provide a temporary energy boost, consuming them in high quantities or regularly over time can have negative consequences on your overall health.",

        "input": "Question: Why are magnet trains faster than normal trains?\nAnswer: 1. Magnet trains, also known as maglev trains, are faster than normal trains because they use a different technology that eliminates friction between the train and the tracks.\n2. By doing so, they can achieve higher speeds more efficiently while also providing a smoother, quieter ride.\n3. In a conventional train, the wheels are in direct contact with the tracks, which creates friction as the train moves.\n4. This friction limits the train's top speed and requires more energy to overcome.\n5. Additionally, this friction can lead to wear and tear on the wheels and tracks, requiring maintenance and potentially causing noise and vibrations.\n6. Maglev trains, on the other hand, use powerful magnets to levitate the train above the tracks.\n7. One set of magnets on the train is repelled by a corresponding set on the tracks, which lifts the train up and keeps it suspended in midair.\n8. Another set of magnets arranged along the tracks propels the train forward by attracting the front of the train and repelling the rear.\n9. This setup eliminates the friction between the train and the tracks, allowing maglev trains to reach much higher speeds than conventional trains \u2013 up to 375 mph (600 km/h) compared to around 186 mph (300 km/h) for high-speed traditional trains.\n10. In summary, maglev trains are faster than normal trains because they use magnetic levitation to eliminate the friction that slows down traditional trains riding on tracks, which allows for much higher speeds and greater efficiency.",

Squatting becomes harder to remove because it involves residency.\n2. Trespassing is a temporary invasion of property, while squatting is the unauthorized occupation of someone's property.\n3.

        "input": "Question: How do banks fail and what happens next? Hey everyone. Been seeing a lot of articles about silicon valley bank failing. Says it was the first big bank since 2008 to do so.\nAnswer: 1. This bank targets starts up.\n2. They have looser \"riskier\" profiles they will lend to and offer high returns for accounts.\n3. They were heavily invested in long term bonds.\n4. When the govt started raising bonds, existing bonds become less appealing because they had lower rates.\n5. This is important.\n6. When the govt raises the price to borrow, lending slows.\n7. Starts-ups.\n8. .\n9. .\n10. .\n11. Start up less because it expensive.\n12. Investment slow, banks taking in less money (assets.\n13. )now at the same time, the banks clients are feeling the same pressure so they withdraw money from the bank.\n14. The bank now has to sell the bonds it bought at a discount, essentially taking a less to pay back it's clients.\n15. Multiply this out and suddenly the bank fails because it can't repay everyone who is asking for their money because they've lost money.\n16. Think of this way - pretend 10 people gave you 1000 dollars each a year ago.\n17. You put $9000 in the stock market and hold on to $1000.\n18. The s&p has dropped ~8% in the last year so your investment is currently worth $8280all 10 people ask for their money back.\n19. You cover the first person with cash on hand ($1000)you cover 8 other people ($8000)you can only give $280 to the last person.\n20. You now have no money or investment (assets) and you still owe $720.\n21. Youre bankrupt (failed.\n22. )now the govt comes and steps in (in reality before you've sold all your investments) and takes your assets or has a healthy bank takeover.\n23. They pay the customers the federally protected amount $250k with any remaining money + govt money.\n24.

Is eagerness for conflict part of the self-preservation of the patriarchy?

I read a few articles where some of these civilizations main focus was keeping warm because they were located so far north. So why would they not migrate more south?\nAnswer: 1. It's a matter of specialization.\n2. In nature, there's a concept called \"niche partitioning\".\n3. If two species are competing for the same resources (food, living space, etc).\n4. There are ultimately 2 outcomes:1) one of the creatures gets progressively better than the other, outcompeting them to extinction.\n5. 2) both creatures specialise into different areas, allowing them to live without having to compete against eachother as much, if at all.\n6. A similar situation can be seen in cultures.\n7. War between different groups was common in the americas, even before European settlement, and understandably so.\n8. If you're a hunter-gatherer society, and your population is growing, you are going to need more land to hunt in, and you hunting there means others can't.\n9. (this is a concept known as scarcity)since humans are always the most dangerous predator around, and niceties are only afforded when survival isn't an issue, other people are always a significant problem.\n10. Cultures like the inuit survived because they understood this, and decided that they'd learn to follow the food, wherever it may be.\n11. There was a choice: either fight others to maintain hunting territory, or go somewhere that no one wanted to hunt in.\n12. They chose the latter, and went further north.\n13.

Every comment here is wrong.\n2. First, we need to understand the problem.\n3. It is really easy to get the order of things wrong.\n4. The us government already ordered so much spending, which, yes, is greater than the taxes it brings in.\n5. In order to finance the spending the us issues debt, that is sought after and wanted by many parties both inside and outside the us.\n6. Since congress ordered this spending, the government has no right not to spend the money.\n7. The debt limit is a relic of wwi where congress went from approving every individual bond issued by the us to telling the treasury, \"you do it, just don't go above this limit without our say so\".\n8. Now, the us government has hit that limit and needs permission to go higher since the spending has already been ordered.\n9. This is analogous to buying something on a credit card and deciding at a certain point you have too much debt, so you just aren't going to pay the bill.\n10. Not that you will spend less, but that you won't pay for what you already bought.\n11. This long explanation is to say the only problem with the us government paying its debt is not lack of funds or willing creditors it is an arbitrary limit that was decided on for no real reason.\n12. The coin gets around this arbitrary, made-up limit by increasing the assets the us officially has, so the net debt is lower, and thus, the debt limit has not been reached.\n13. If it is legal it will have no, zero, knock on effects to the economy.\n14. Of course, that isn't going to happen because if it did, then congress could just normally raise the limit normally and the coin would not be necessary.",

I did some reading about harnessing the apparent wind (the resulting wind summing true wind and boat-moving wind), thus the faster you go the faster you can go, but am still confused.

If you move in the direction of the wind then when you reach its speed there will be no apparent wind speed, since the wind isn't moving any faster than you are.\n3. Instead the boat is moving in a direction somewhat perpendicular to the wind.\n4. The wind applies a pressure on the boat via the sail, and the keel directs this pressure into movement in a different direction.\n5. Because the boat is moving across the direction of the wind even if it reaches the same speed as the wind there is no diminishing of the apparent wind force.\n6.

Say you have $10,000, and you want to turn it into $11,000 by loaning it out.\n2. - you loan $100 to 100 people in low-risk group 1.\n3. Three of them will default; you'll get $0 from those.\n4.

It was so huge, so expansive, I don't understand how they'd even communicate something from one end to the other since it'd take months to hear anything. So how is it they could have managed all that?\nAnswer: 1. A big part of why they were so successful for long was that the romans tended to give local governments a large amount of autonomy as long as they paid their taxes, recognized the authority of rome, and didn't cause too much of a headache for whatever local roman authority there was.\n2. So typically after the romans conquered an area (after militarily defeating the locals), they would simply leave most of the local power structures in place, but that local authority now answered to the new roman governor of the area, who was likely in charge of several legions that could completely dominate any potential rebellion.\n3. These governors were generally appointed by the senate, or, during imperial times, by the emperor himself and were generally expected to be loyal and keep things under control.\n4. The actual duties of provincial governors varied from province to province, but the most important ones generally were in command of large portions of the roman military (and often became contenders for the imperial throne when civil wars broke out).\n5. As for communication, they operated fairly independently but would regularly correspond with higher ups (i.\n6. E.\n7. The emperor), providing updates and requests for guidance or supplies.\n8.

        "input": "Question: Why do established brands spend so much on advertising the 2 for 5 bk deal, the biggie bag from wendy\u2019s, mcdonald\u2019s.\nAnswer: 1. I worked in advertising for a long time.\n2. You're focusing on one metric - awareness.\n3. Are people aware the brand exists?\n4. So for these big legacy brands, you're right, they already have awareness.\n5. But that's not the only metric that drives sales.\n6. I'm going to break down some of the other reasons brands advertise.\n7. 1.\n8. **new product awareness** \\- you may know swiffer exists.\n9. You might not know that they have a new re-fillable mop, for example.\n10. So doesn't matter that you know the brand exists, they want to let you know the new product exists2.\n11. **perception -** over time, the perception of a brand can change depending on what's going on in the world around them.\n12. So swiffer might be popular today, but there might be a lot of environmental awareness next year and suddenly people don't want disposable products as much.\n13. So then they'll re-position the same product, with something like, 'less hassle'.\n14. 3.\n15. **preference over competitors -** what drives a purchase isn't just knowing that a product exists.\n16. It's about believing it's better than their competitors.\n17. There's a subconscious thing that happens where things that we're familiar with we believe are 'better.\n18. ' so if tide didn't advertise for a few years, but gain did, people might start believing gain is better, simply because they see the name everywhere.\n19. This also includes having a better deal than competitors.\n20. So for car brands, for example, two competing brands might have two similar products, but one has better financing, so they'll advertise that.\n21. 4.\n22. **driving foot traffic -** some of the brands you mentioned, like wendy's or burger king, need people to actually go into a physical location to purchase.\n23. Sometimes having a 2 for 5 deal will drive people into the store who otherwise might not have gone5.\n24. **addressing sales dips** \\- sometimes a brand's sales dip.\n25. This could be for any number of reasons.\n26. In this scenario, you do research to find the reason for it, and do advertising to let people know about your solution.\n27. So maybe if you're burger king, people stopped coming because they felt the inside was 'dirty', when really it was out of date.\n28. So you redesigned your interior, and the 2 for 5 deal isn't about that at all, it's to get people inside to see the new designthere are more reasons than this, but the gist is that people make purchases for a number of complex decisions based on the options available to them, not just whether or not they know something exists, and advertising is meant to respond to the current context in which people are making their purchases.\n29. These big brands spend a lot of money tracking the health of their brand in the market, how people perceive them, and their competitors, and advertise accordingly to what their research tells them is required to keep their sales up.",

Julius Caesar was a General and the provincial governor of Gaul (https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/caesar-crosses-rubicon/). At the time of the crossing in 49 BC, Rome was a republic and the Senate forbade armies from the provinces from entering the city. This law was instituted by the Curiate Assembly (Comitia Curiata), a body consisting of patricians (wealthy landowners), who declared that soldiers and armies were only to be permitted within the city of Rome via the issuing of a Triumph - a ceremonial victory march through Rome, often issued after a successful military campaign (Hunt, P.

[Incomplete] Reasons: This answer lacks information about the need for a diplomatic solution - what is the context of Caeser's decision to cross the Rubicon? What would be the objective of diplomacy, presumably between Caesar and the Republican Senate, if Caesar had not crossed the Rubicon? These are important contextualizing questions that illustrate why the highlighted text is an incomplete argument. It can be argued that because of Caesar's popularity with the Roman citizenry, stemming from his numerous victories and successful expansions of Rome's borders, that this incentivized him to seek higher power and stem the power of his chief political rivals in the Senate, namely General Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (simply 'Pompey')(https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/caesar-crosses-rubicon/). It can also be argued that contemporaries viewed  Caesar's decision as having always been his intention, Cicero describes this as Caesar protecting his *Dignitas* (treatment appropriate to one's standing) without having any *honestas*(honour) (Griffin, Miriam, 'Dignity in Roman and Stoic Thought', in Remy Debes (ed.), Dignity: A History, OXFORD PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS (New York, 2017; online edn, Oxford Academic, 22 June 2017), (https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199385997.003.0003). Thus, contemporaries believed that there could be no diplomatic solution.

Yolks are also emulsifiers, meaning that they make it so that fats and water can mix; there's chemicals in yolks called lecithins that have a long oily bit that likes to be near fats at one end, and a charged bit that likes to touch water at the other, letting the fat and water to get close.\n4. The egg doesn't have a lot of tough stringy stuff holding it together like meat, and the water in there makes it easy to mix and pour.\n5. The protein can be whipped so it unfolds and makes a foam that traps air.\n6. The protein in eggs also unfolds when cooked making it hold together things and trap in moisture.\n7. The yolks allow oil and water to mix so they won't separate (yay, mayonaise!\n8. ) and are also very good at trapping in moisture, but have much less protein so they make for something softer and less rubbery.\n9.

I can't see the downside to houses getting cheaper. What kind of struggles do homeowners go through when the market is down? What else changes besides the price of their home? I know almost nothing about economics so a simple explanation would be appreciated.\nAnswer: 1. >i can't see the downside to houses getting cheaper.\n2. You're only thinking about buyers, not owners.\n3. For people who already own homes, if home values fall quickly, owners can find themselves underwater on their mortgages, which means they must either stay in the house until the market recovers or sell and lose money.\n4. When home prices drop during housing market crash, homeowners can end up owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth and can no longer sell their homes to get out from under crushing mortgage payments.\n5. People with floating interest rate mortgages will suddenly see their monthly mortgage payments skyrocket because their interest rates have gone way up, if they cannot make the new, higher payments, they will lose their homes to foreclosure and often have to file for bankruptcy in the process, ruining their credit and their ability to obtain future mortgages or other types of loans for many years.\n6. In short, housing market crashes can financially decimate homeowners.\n7. &#x200b;edit: I didn't plan on addressing any of the comments on here but I've seen enough comments along the lines of \"homeowners deserve it\" or \"it's their fault for gambling on a home loan\" or \"their fault for not planning better\" or \"i have to pay rent so its good that homeowners suffer like me\" that I need to speak up.\n8. People making this comments are ignorant and spiteful.\n9. The vast majority of homeowners are middle class families who bought their homes to live in.\n10. Their homes are the only thing they will ever own with substantial value and the only thing they will ever own of substantial value that they can pass on to their children.\n11. So much of the reason for racial wealth inequality in the u.\n12. S.\n13. Is because for a really long time (and to some extent, still today), black people could not get home loans and thus could not pass on a home to their children to build up inter-generational wealth the way that white people could.\n14.

If people need to borrow lots of money to buy houses, then the price of houses is very responsive to how cheap it is to borrow money.\n4.

Much more expensive borrowing has led to demand for houses to dry up very, very fast and will, in all likelihood, lead to price declines in the housing sector.\n7. *technically, they raise an interest rate for interbank borrowing that has nothing directly to do with mortgages, but it causes money to become pricier to borrow, overall, and thus affects interest rates for all lending.",

The achy feeling is caused three things:- general inflammation.\n3. The immune system uses inflammation basically as a way of communicating to itself and other body systems \"send resources here to help me fight the infection\".\n4. This inflammation itself causes pain, and sometimes it can spill over into areas of the body that aren't in need of special attention.\n5. There's a theory that this muscle and joint 'spill-over' inflammation pain is 'intentional' by evolution, because it causes us to be less active, which helps with recovery (rest), but this hasn't been proven.\n6. - toxic activities by the immune system.\n7. In some places, the immune system (white blood cells) are actually killing other cells that have become infected.\n8. The chemicals used to send these \"kill\" messages can also have a 'spill-over' into other areas of the body, causing pain.\n9. This is not a major part of sickness aches, though.\n10. - swollen lymph nodes.\n11. Your body is covered in hundreds of lymph nodes connected by a separate circulation network.\n12.

It depends on your credit rating what kind of interest you'll get on your loan, and what the long term stock market trends are, or if you want to buy multiple properties at the same time, for example.\n3. But making money in the stock market is not a given, so there is risk involved in going that route.\n4.

        "input": "Question: Why do solids molecules vibrate?\nAnswer: 1. Molecules normally attract each other but begin repelling each other when they get too close.\n2. This action is somewhat similar to how a spring works, so you could imagine neighboring molecules in a solid as connected by tiny springs.\n3. Obviously this makes the whole molecular structure kinda wobbly - pull on one molecule and through all those springs the other molecules react; let that molecule go and every other molecule reacts as well.\n4. And since the surface of the solid is always interacting with something from the outside, this translates into random vibrations of the spring-tied molecules around some average locations.",

It seems like the mind is telling the person to do something but one cannot get themselves to actually do it.\nAnswer: 1. When everything you need to do feels like the same amount of effort as climbing a mountain, there are going to be a lot of days where there's not enough motivation in the tank to do those tasks.\n2. Pressure or fear (such as a looming deadline or giant consequences that are immediate and understandable) can force you up the mountain, but instead of the leisurely hike it should have been, it becomes a mad scramble.\n3. This causes a significant amount of unnecessary hardship and is very unpleasant.\n4. Basically, you let a bear chase you up the mountain because without it you'll sit at the bottom forever.\n5.

The oxygen would much rather be with the aluminum and you've created the perfect environment to allow it to move.\n4. The oxygen moves over the to the aluminum and you have black aluminum and shiny silver instead of the other way around.\n5.

Suppose for example we took the usd and multiplied everything by 10, adding a zero on the end of every price.\n3.

It just means that people are willing to pay more to get the product, making it easy for prices to rise dramatically in a shortage.\n3. Sometimes the cause is that there's no alternative, as when gas prices spiked in the 1970s, or if all food runs short.\n4. If there are alternatives then rises tend not to be so dramatic.\n5. In the case of eggs the evidence is that people are willing to pay more to have them rather than do without eggs or products that contain eggs.\n6. In most cases eggs were a relatively small part of consumers' budgets so many can afford to pay quadruple.\n7.

        "input": "Question: Why older cartridge games freeze on a single frame rather than crashing completely? What makes the console \"stick\" on the last given instruction, rather than cutting to a color or corrupting the screen?\nAnswer: 1. The way games usually work is that there is a large part of the executed code to calculate the game world (i.\n2. E.\n3. Where is everything, what values does everything have, what is the next step for the ai, etc.\n4. ), and then render the scene in one go and update the screen with that new scene rendition.\n5. The graphics card will just put on screen whatever it was last told to output, forever.\n6. So if any of that fails, you are stuck with whatever the latest \"update the screen\" did.\n7. In modern software, the game runs in a container, which is monitored by the operating system, and as soon as a crash is detected, the os will kill that container, present a nice error message to the user, and then continue on as if the game was never started.\n8. In older consoles, the game was basically taking direct control of the console's hardware, including the graphics card, so if the game crashed there was nothing there to detect that crash and order the graphics card to display something else.\n9.

        "input": "Question: How does rent keep getting higher and higher? Won't people just stop staying there?\nAnswer: 1. Supply and demand.\n2. Sure, you could end your lease, but where will you go?\n3. If there are lots of rental properties to choose from for a small number of renters, then landlords will have to compete for tenants.\n4. That means setting a competitive price.\n5. But if there are few rental properties and many people looking for a place to rent, then landlords don't need to compete.\n6. They can set a high price, and if you can't afford it, then they'll just rent the place to someone else.\n7. In short, rent prices go up when (rental) housing is scarce.\n8. They'll (generally) only go down when more housing becomes available.\n9. With housing you also have to factor in that it's a very basic need.\n10. If the price of jewelry goes up, people can just buy less jewelry.\n11. If you can no longer afford to pay your TV subscription, you can cancel it.\n12.

The website can use a \"filler\" (not sure if there's a term for it) page in between pages that automatically forwards to another page.\n2. Instead of going from page a to b (the desired page), it goes from a to c (\"filler\" page), which executes a script to automatically redirect you to b.\n3.

But if it was possible to make unreasonably large gems, we'd be seeing one-piece emerald kitchen counter slabs on the market right now and people with enough means would be making gemstone windows.\nAnswer: 1. The largest synthetic gemstones are actually **huge**.\n2. We can grow some single(!\n3. ) crystals such as quartz and sapphires that are way beyond anything natural, in the hundreds of kilograms, and that at an extreme purity.\n4.

And unlike sapphire, they have a less wide use in industrial and consumer applications, adding further to the cost and lack of interest to optimize their size.\n8. Meanwhile, large so-called boules of sapphire are used for very sturdy \"glass\" (not really a glass), and ruby is used for lasers.\n9.

I work at an airport and we use \u201cpig pads\u201d which are absorbent sheets that can be placed on a pool of water and only absorb the fuel, oils, or whatever else while not absorbing any water. What about the sheets allows this?\nAnswer: 1. The reason this works is the same reason oil and water don't mix: a phenomenon of chemistry called polarity.\n2. Basically every different compound has a different level of polarity, and would prefer to surround itself with molecules of a similar polarity.\n3. This causes molecules to separate based on this property, and allows your pads to pick up oil and leave the water behind!\n4. Polarity works because of a property called electronegativity, which is a measure of how strongly each element can attract electrons.\n5. In a molecule with covalent bonds, electrons are shared.\n6. This sharing is not equal however, as the electron does not divide its time equally between the two atoms sharing the bond.\n7. Instead, the element with a stronger electronegativity get a larger share of the electron's time, which makes that part of the molecule a little bit negatively charged.\n8. This makes a different part of the molecule to have a little bit of a positive charge.\n9. The strength of these small relative charges is called the molecules polarity.\n10. Wanna hear something really cool?\n11. I use this property everyday in my lab in a technique called chromatography to separate the different molecules in human blood and isolate the specific molecule that i'm studying.\n12.

Legitimate interest is probably the most confusing of the grounds for using your data, because it's so wide.\n2. The basic idea is actually pretty simple.\n3. A legitimate interest is kind of like something that\u2019s normal and expected for an organisation to do, and is either important or of minimal impact to people's privacy.\n4. For example, where I work we use legitimate interest as a reason for carrying out customer satisfaction surveys.\n5. It\u2019s not essential for the service, but it\u2019s a normal and unsurprising thing for a company to do.\n6. A website might do the same with regards to collecting data to improve the performance of the site.\n7. There\u2019s been a shift in the last couple of years so that companies regards doing all sorts of advertising-related things with your data as normal and expected and thus a legitimate interest.\n8. To be classed as a legitimate interest, the impact on the individual has to be minimal, or there has to be a compelling reason for using the data in this way.\n9. Organisations should also consider whether there\u2019s a better way to meet their objectives, and if it would be better to ask the customer\u2019s consent instead.\n10. Legitimate interest is a useful ground for an organisation because you don\u2019t need to actively ask for someone\u2019s permission.\n11. They have to be able to opt-out, but not opt-in.\n12. Now you might be asking \u201cwhy do sites often ask me both for consent *and* legitimate interest on the same things?\n13. \u201d i\u2019m not sure there is a good reason for this.\n14. It\u2019s not required by data protection laws, and I think it\u2019s against the spirit and possibly even the letter of the law.\n15.

        "input": "Question: How is naked short selling possible? I know the practice is illegal, so that's not what i'm asking about. I don't understand how something like this is possible at all. How can you sell a security and get actual money for it when you don't even possess it at all, even if borrowed? Wouldn't some party in the financial markets see that you didn't borrow these shares to short sell? Who is the interest that borrowed shares get going to if you didn't borrow them? I just don't understand how this process could even theoretically work without it being extremely obvious immediately that the shorting party is doing something fraudulent.\nAnswer: 1. So the thing is, selling a stock isn't strictly an instant transaction where you give me money and I give you a stock.\n2. Rather, it's a contract: I *promise* that I *will* give you a stock by some time in the future.\n3. Note that this is actually similar to the way that many physical goods are ordered and delivered.\n4. When I go down to the grocery store to buy some eggs, i'm picking out eggs that are physically on the shelves.\n5. But other types of goods, like a major appliance or something, they don't have a pile of all the different models of fridges in the back.\n6. I'm buying something that the store doesn't physically have on hand, and they promise to deliver it in a week, and they'll get one from the warehouse or the manufacturer.\n7. Unless they don't.\n8. Supply chain issues.\n9. What happens then depends on the contract you signed.\n10. Still, we put up with the occasional unreliability because there ain't no way someone can have all the fridges on hand to sell, and the store doesn't want to order more inventory if they don't have a buyer lined up.\n11. Similar to short-selling: there's a buyer, there's *probably* a seller, stocks are fungible.\n12. We'll sort the details out later.\n13. For stocks, this works just fine in a regular market where you can know that you'll probably be able to buy a stock, and maybe you'll wait for the price to dip before you do.\n14. When the market is pear-shaped, then you can't buy the stock (or it costs too much).\n15. Failure to deliver a stock isn't illegal, but will have some contractual penalty.\n16. One way of thinking of it, is that the short-seller is buying *risk* and selling *certainty*.\n17. Both parties stake on the price *now*, and the short-seller is the one who is making a bet on the price fluctuating in the short-term.\n18. The buyer will get the stock, and even if they know the seller doesn't have it now, they have a guarantee that the seller will eat the difference if the price moves.",

To start off, the Chinese government has a habit and history of having back doors into a lot of products made by companies that have their home there.\n3. For example, huawei, a company known for phones and servers was ~~discovered a a few years back to have been putting gov.\n4. Back doors into server chips used by American companies.\n5. ~~ under heavy suspicion by American companies and others for having backdoor in their systems after various security flaws were found.\n6. On top of that, most analysis of the app itself have set off quite a few red flags, such as requiring way more security permissions than it should need, their terms of service requiring you to allow them to \"build a full profile,\" on you including who you interact with and every bit of info about you, and iirc was found to be uploading keystrokes or copied clipboard data at frequent intervals, which is a great way to get someone's passwords and/or other sensitive data.\n7.

Here in the us (and most western countries) we not only have privacy laws that protect us from certain breaches, but more importantly the government and company are two separate entities, and are even frequently at each-other's throats.\n15. While all those companies certainly collect data, they are *not* responsible for handing it directly to their government outside of official process such as warrants and subpoenas.\n16. In China it's the opposite, companies over a certain size are required to by law to allow the government to access and have direct control over large sections of the companies operations.\n17. The problem worsens when we remember that China isn't really the best of friends with a lot of western nations, and giving *them specifically* control over what large numbers of western people (especially youth) see and interact with is not great for national security.\n18.

If you're a bank, the worst thing that can happen is someone coming up to the counter asking for their money and you not being able to give it to them.\n2. That causes your customers (account holders) to lose all confidence in you, and they will all promptly try to withdraw their money in hopes that they can get some of their money out.\n3. This is called a bank run or a run on the bank.\n4. Side note: most if not all privately held accounts at banks are protected by the fdic, the federal deposit insurance corporation.\n5. The fdic protects banks and their customers by guaranteeing each account up to $250,000; if you try to withdraw and the bank is unable to pay you, the fdic will pay out for you instead.\n6. So a bank temporarily stopping withdrawals is a way to get ahead of a bank run.\n7. The idea is to buy time while the bank tries to get more funds in (from loan payments or other assets), so that they can reopen later, pay out withdrawals, and not run out of money.",

This is possible because liters is a measurement of volume, and a gas (or steam) can expand to take up whatever volume is available to it (the entire chimney).\n2. What stays the same is the mass / weight: 1 liter of water weighs 1 kilogram, and if you capture all the steam into a balloon, that'll also weigh exactly 1 kilogram.\n3. But the balloon with steam will be much more inflated (a lot more liters) than a balloon with 1 kilogram of liquid water.\n4.

You put all the sample into order and then the median is at the halfway mark.\n3. For income it means half the population earn more and half earn less.\n4. *mean* is another type of average - you add all the sample values together and then divide by the number of samples.\n5.

Eg for income a handful of billionaires can radically skew the result to show a much higher income or wealth than any ordinary person is realistically on.\n8. Mean is useful for a lot of statistical analysis, and for some types of average when the distribution of results follows a certain pattern and there are either no outliers or outliers are balanced.\n9.

It boils down to drones having electric motors while helicopters have an internal combustion engine.\n2. The helicopter\u2019s engine can only go at very high rpms (revolutions per minute), so you need a transmission system to reduce those rpms for the blade.\n3. You can\u2019t really afford having four independent transmissions in a helicopter.\n4. A quadcopter has four independent electric motors which can turn at whatever speed required and so are connected directly to the rotors without any transmission.\n5. This makes for relatively easy control of flight by changing the speeds of different motors to move in the desired direction.\n6. A helicopter has another complicated system for adjusting the angle of the blade instead.\n7.

        "input": "Question: Typically, respect for the dead and their remains is paramount, so why is it ok to cut open the tombs of ancient leaders whose bodies have been laid to rest for more than 2000 years?\nAnswer: 1. In most cases, it\u2019s not about the dead so much as it is about the living.\n2. In cases where excavation of ancient tombs is genuinely non-controversial (which is probably rarer than you think), it\u2019s because the population that can best lay claim to being descendants of the dead no longer practice the religion of the deceased and don\u2019t oppose the work and/or are engaged in the work themselves as a form of preservation of national and cultural heritage.\n3. In the cases where it\u2019s controversial, the people leading the opposition see the practice as a direct violation of people they still feel kinship with based on ancestry and shared cultural and religious beliefs, and/or experience the excavations as a modern day colonialism in which outsiders are pillaging relics that don\u2019t belong to them for export to benefit nations that have no ethical or cultural claim to the gravesite.",

The author rejects the first misconception in the question, however, their language is more passive and lacks direct wording to relate to the question and the rest of the answer. It would be beneficial if the author were to alter this text instead to reflect their ultimate argument- that excavating ancient tombs can only be a positive action if it directly benefits the community that culturally identifies a shared history with the subject (contents of the tomb) of the excavation. Additionally, it would also be beneficial if the author asserted that it is 'wrong' to assume that respect for the dead and their remains is paramount but instead that the moral issues around excavation are often today forgotten or beleaguered by bureaucratic complexities such as the need for local authorities to consult academic and scientific experts on the 'pros and cons' of excavation, and the relevant land laws in place in the jurisdiction where the excavation is planned.See Loe, L., Clough, S.

While credit card fraud is a problem, it\u2019s not overwhelming to banks.\n2. Just like stores expect some shoplifting and include the costs of that in their prices, banks expect some fraud and include those costs in the fees they charge.\n3. Banks also have lots of ways to detect fraud, and can often catch it before there are too many charges.\n4. They have algorithms that look for charges outside a customer\u2019s normal area, at places they don\u2019t normally shop, etc.\n5. When i\u2019ve had a fraudulent charge, the bank itself has always been the one to catch it and call me.\n6. Also, you need more than a credit card number to shop.\n7. In person, you need the card itself.\n8. If a store runs just the number off a piece of paper, they would be liable for the charges.\n9. Spoofing cards is harder, especially the new chip cards.\n10.

Since it hasn\u2019t been explicitly mentioned yet: a lot of people don\u2019t want to (or feel like they simply *can\u2019t*) move because they\u2019re sitting on a very low interest mortgage.\n2. In other words, let\u2019s say you bought a $400,000 home a few years ago with 20% down and a 3% mortgage.\n3. You\u2019d be paying around $2,200/month for principal and interest.\n4. (edit: for a 15 year mortgage.\n5. )that home might be worth $550,000 now, so you\u2019d think it\u2019d be a great time to move with all the equity.\n6. But people have to have somewhere to live, and if they can\u2019t find a home they like for a lot less money, a different $550,000 home - even with \u2248$160,000 down - will run you around $3,300/mo in mortgage payments at current \u22486% interest rates.\n7. In a nutshell, lower supply because people aren\u2019t moving, means higher prices.\n8. Edit: as was pointed out, I had the 15 year box checked, not 30, when I ran those numbers - even though *technically* I didn\u2019t specify, the assumption these days is for a 30 year mortgage.\n9.

This is what gives peppermint or spearmint it's cool feeling on your tongue.\n6. No actual change in temperature on your skin happens.\n7. The methyl salicylate is similar to aspirin in its structure and when absorbed it causes the blood vessels to dialate.\n8. This promotes blood flow to the area which makes the skin feel warm.\n9. Especially when contrasted with the cooling effect of menthol.\n10. The increased blood flow also helps with muscle repair.\n11. So step by step.\n12. You've applied the cream and the active ingredient hits your skin.\n13. The menthol is absorbed immediately and makes your skin feel cold.\n14.

        "input": "Question: What does carbon monoxide do? Like what is its purpose of existing? ((had a scare earlier this morning. . . . . . ))\nAnswer: 1. There is no purpose, it's just a natural by-product of combustion with fuels that contain carbon (which is most of them).\n2. Combustion is when oxygen binds to atoms, which creates a very strong bond.\n3. That creation of a strong bond releases energy.\n4. Most of the time, one carbon atom will bind with two oxygen atoms to make carbon dioxide.\n5. Sometimes, though, only one oxygen atom and one carbon atom meet, creating carbon monoxide.\n6. Carbon dioxide is very non-reactive.\n7. The oxygen atoms are bound tightly to the carbon atom, and there are no free electrons to grab onto another atom.\n8. Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, *does* have some free electrons on the carbon where another atom of molecule would bind to it as carbon dioxide.\n9. When carbon monoxide gets into your body, it sticks to the iron atoms inside your hemoglobin proteins which carry oxygen around through your blood.\n10. With the carbon monoxide in the way, that hemoglobin can't hold any oxygen.\n11. Since hemoglobin is built to hold onto and let go of o2 molecules, your body doesn't have any good tools to get rid of carbon monoxide.\n12. The side that's facing away from the hemoglobin is the oxygen atom, which is still bound tightly to the carbon, so nothing else can really grab onto that oxygen atom to pull the carbon monoxide off.\n13. That means carbon monoxide tends to stick to your hemoglobin much longer than oxygen would, so it stays in your blood from carrying oxygen for a long time.\n14. Since your blood can't carry oxygen as well as it needs to with the carbon monoxide in the way, your cells slowly suffocate and die.",

        "input": "Question: Why almost all ancient civilization have extremely similar stories involving strange creatures like mermaids, big foot, gods, demons and so on?\nAnswer: 1. There are many different possible explanations, and the actual real reason is probably some combination of them.\n2. One possibility is that different cultures have similar ideas because they historically dealt with similar problems or catastrophes that inspired these myths.\n3. For example, a 'primordial flood' is a common idea in mythologies around the world.\n4. Ancient peoples around the world probably actually did deal with catastrophic floods that wiped away entire cities.\n5. They were built in river valleys after all.\n6. An apocalyptic flood in time immemorial could have inspired later story tellers to use that as a common trope for \"a big event that changed the world forever\" similar to how modern day people might use \"zombie apocalypse\" as a common story telling device.\n7. Another school of thought, more common among religious studies scholars, would argue that these stories and myths are similar because they serve a similar sociological function.\n8. So, it's kind of complicated, but the idea here is that religious (or mythological) beliefs serve an important function for society, fulfilling some psycho-social need.\n9. Or possibly, acting as an important symbol for some structure in society, so that people can better understand it.\n10. For example, demons and faeries in lots of cultures are said to inhabit 'ritually unclean' places like graveyards, latrines, abandoned buildings, etc.\n11. One could argue that the function of these mythological creatures is to personify the otherwise abstract notion that these places are spiritually dangerous.\n12. And maybe different cultures have similar ideas, because they have similar needs for symbols like these.\n13. Finally, a third explanation would just be cultural diffusion.\n14. Maybe they're similar because they're just actually the same idea originally.\n15. These are pretty compelling ideas that could easily spread from culture to culture through contact.\n16. There's a theory, for example, that the arabic concept of *jinn* (genie) is actually related to the greco-roman conception of *genius* - a gaurdian spirit that could aid a person, or inhabit a place.\n17. Ancient civilizations did have contact with each other and might just have shared ideas.",

It was a task doomed to fail.\n9. The us has had success fighting other less complex battles, like essentially exterminating isis and isil.\n10.

        "input": "Question: Where did the santa mythos come from? Why is it generally agreed upon in western society that he\u2019s a fat old man who lives in the north pole at a workshop with elves and reindeer?\nAnswer: 1. Santa is an americanized version of saint nicholas, derived from the dutch version of the name sinter klaas.\n2. Saint nicholas was a roman monk that gave away his worldly possessions (possibly having inherited great wealth) by traveling the turkish countryside and giving it to those who needed help.\n3. His story is almost as old as jesus, having originated around 250 ad (possibly as late as 400ad).\n4. He was so well liked that he was still celebrated when the catholic church was being reviled in the protestant reformation.\n5. Celebrating this real person is where we get almost all the santa related stuff, even the weird stuff because although he was from what is now Turkey, our version of his legends came through the Netherlands and were brought here by the dutch settling in the midwest, so he got retroconned to being a bishop from the Netherlands.\n6. The stylized American santa claus came from an artist, thomas nash, who submitted drawings to a magazine, harper's weekly.\n7.

        "input": "Question: What were the main features sociopolitically/culturally/etc that historians use to distinguish between the early, high and late middle ages?\nAnswer: 1. The general dividing lines are these:the fall of the western roman empire in the 400s marks the end of \"antiquity\" and begins the early middle ages, which are often just referred to by some historians as \"late antiquity\".\n2. The norman invasion and the crusades of the 1000s typically mark the transition from the early middle ages to the high middle ages.\n3. The late middle ages typically begins around 1300 with the black death and the hundred years' war and ends with the expansion of the renaissance out of Italy in the 1500s.\n4. It is hard in a eli5 structure to cover everything, but the main features that separate them all (and these are certainly debated) are basically levels of organization -- politically, economically, and socially.\n5. The early middle ages are a time of fragmentation -- the roman empire is carved up amongst the German invaders and the vast roman trading and social networks quickly fall apart without the empire to sustain them.\n6. Princes and kings try to organize greater political systems but the only one that really manages to stick around through constant in-fighting, viking raids, and economic turmoil is the catholic church.\n7. It takes western Europe basically all of the coordination they can muster to keep the invading moors out of France, and even then they have no ability to take back any part of Spain and won't for hundreds of years.\n8. By the 1000s, you can start to see the foundations of modern Europe.\n9. Places like \"France\" and \"england\" start to take on a familiar shape as political stability takes hold.\n10. Trade across the northern seas and the mediterranean starts to grow more standardized and consistent -- a small middle class of guildsmen and merchants starts to grow.\n11. European kingdoms are organized enough that when the pope calls for a crusade, these states can actually organize armies and send them hundreds of miles into the levant.\n12. There's a renewed interest in greek and roman sciences, backed by exposure to new ideas coming out of the middle east.\n13. Everything is bigger and more organized than it was 200 years ago, if only moderately so.\n14. By the 1300s, Europe is \"developed\" enough that it can withstand the massive upheavals about to hit it: the black death, peasant revolts, a religious schism, and prolonged war with the turks.\n15. European kingdoms are much more stable political entities -- the death of a king doesn't threaten to topple the entire country and the systems of government can (mostly) sustain war or plague without completely falling apart.\n16. Countries as we might recognize them today start to exist -- from Sweden to Spain to Hungary.\n17. Soon enough these countries will be organized enough to start fielding (and, most importantly, paying) standing armies, something basically unheard-of since the roman times.\n18.

For example, it would be beneficial to state that the 'Moors' were North African Muslims and that they invaded the Iberian Peninsula (what is modern-day Spain and Portugal) in AD.711, creating the economic and scientific stronghold of al-Andalus. Western Europe is often referred to as 'Christendom' since the Fall of Rome in AD.476 - this term was important for representing the unity of political states and Christian religious institutions in Western and Eastern Europe as a foundation for civilization, and this representation became increasing important following the Moorish conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and the eventual beginning of the First Crusade in AD.1096.

Two weeks ago I moved from the midlands to somerset (c90 miles) and have swapped softer water for hard hair-wrecking, skin-drying water. Why do different water agencies supply different water?\nAnswer: 1. It's all about the bedrock that the water supply rests on.\n2. Hard water is the result of minerals that dissolve in water, the most common among these are calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.\n3. Carbonates come from limestone bedrock, which dissolves slightly into the water releasing the dissolved ions and making the water hard.\n4. Water that doesn't rest on limestone doesn't have nearly the same level of dissolved ions that water that does rest on limestone bedrock.\n5. Fun fact: the carbonates dissolved in hard water add alkalinity to the water reservoir, meaning a buffer system is created to resist the ph dropping down too far.\n6. This became a benefit when acid rain peaks in the 80s and 90s as a result of air pollution, where water reservoirs resting on limestone didn't acidify as badly as water reservoirs sitting on other types of bedrock.\n7. I'm from new york, and in the adirondack mountains you can tell the difference between lakes sitting on limestone and those sitting on other types of bedrock simply by measuring the ph, as the water sources without a buffering system became so acidified most organisms were unable to live there",

Capillary and muscular action in that part of the body pushing everything out in one direction (not just waste from digested food but if you get a cut, the blood, too, etc.\n2. ), plus a robust immune system that handles most infections.\n3. It's not perfect, though.\n4. And infections do occur.\n5. Look up perianal abscesses when you get a chance, but not while eating.\n6.

An anomaly detection machine finds those outliers that don't match the pattern/rhythm.\n4.

That is, it's *too* clean and uniform as a pattern.\n6. Real language written and spoken by human beings has a lot of anomalies: random changes in mood, emotion, word choice, syntax, etc.\n7.

I have lived in houses without fridges or where the fridge was too small where we did this.\n2. The pantry is usually in the corner of the house so it gets cooler or even an outside pantry.\n3. The problem is that there is very little temperature control.\n4. In the summer temperatures can get quite high even in cold climates so the pantry would become room temperature or even higher.\n5. And in the winter you might risk frost in this pantry which destroys a lot of food.\n6. So it requires constant attention to the temperature and it might not be fully usable for large parts of the year.\n7. Having a fridge inside is not a waste of energy in cold climates.\n8. The fridge will dump its excess heat into the room which means you do not need to heat your house as much using other means.\n9. Even the overhead from the compressor and such that gets got from use will end up as heat inside the house, which is where you want it.\n10.

So, basically we have rim brakes that usually uses some kind of rubber against the rim, so they have a lot of friction plus they are further than the centre of the wheel, then leverage is a lot. Then we have disc brakes that honestly don't know which material is against the steel, but the leverage is way less than rim. What is the explanation of it's stopping power?\nAnswer: 1. For several reasons:1.\n2. Bike wheel rims get dirty and wet when riding (especially off road).\n3. A dirty wet rim doesn't work as a friction surface very well.\n4. Because discs are near the hub, they avoid most of the spashback and remain cleaner.\n5. 2.\n6. Bike wheel rims are made of thin aluminum.\n7. You can't press too hard on a wheel rim or it will bend or tear.\n8. Brake discs are made of thick steel, and can withstand a lot higher loads without breaking.\n9. 3.\n10. Because of the steel disk, you can use a more aggressive brake pad.\n11. Rim brakes have rubber friction pads, while disc brakes have ceramic pads which create a lot more friction.\n12. Using ceramic pads on a rim would quickly destroy the delicate aluminum.\n13. Rim breaking actually has a mechanical advantage, being closer to outside of the wheel gives it a longer moment arm and more stopping power for the same applied friction force.\n14.

Let me rephrase the question - do we call the visible spectrum that because that's what we can see or is there something different about that part of electromagnetic spectrum (es) that allow vision to occur. Alternately, if light is dual in nature, being both a wave and a particle, is that the same for other parts of the es?\nAnswer: 1. Yes, there are creatures that can see outside of the human visible spectrum, but not very far.\n2. Just a bit into the infrared and the ultraviolet.\n3. As for why we can detect those wavelengths, two main reasons.\n4. One, those wavelengths pass through water.\n5. As it is believed that life started in the ocean, the first eyes would only have been able to detect light that could penetrate into the ocean.\n6. Second, these wavelengths have the property that they can interact with small molecules.\n7. Infrared light and longer wavelengths are too big and weak to effect much, and mostly just scatter off our cells.\n8. Ultraviolet light and smaller wavelengths are too small and powerful, and will shoot right through our cells, mostly zipping right through but sometimes causing damage.\n9. The wavelengths in between, however, can be absorbed by the right kind of molecule, and the energy of that absorption can be used to send a signal that \u201chey, I just caught a photon!\n10. \u201d so yes, the visible range does have some special properties that make it suitable for use in vision.\n11. I have heard anecdotal tales of insects being affected by very long wavelengths, like the 120 hz signal from power lines, but I have not seen any scientific confirmation.\n12.

I see people on Tiktok, ig, etc, talking about borrowing against their life insurance policies and doing real estate investing. I am entirely ignorant as to how most financial things work, and i'm guessing posts of that nature are an attempt to prey on that ignorance in some way or another.\nAnswer: 1. Whole life insurance policies accrue a cash value.\n2. Basically at any point throughout the policies life cycle you could cash it in for that cash value.\n3. That cash value is significantly lower than the payout of the insurance policy and it's based on a portion of your premium payments going into that cash value every time.\n4. These people are then using that cash value as collateral to borrow money against which is totally possible.\n5. The major failure point of this entire process is that whole life policies are basically garbage.\n6. They tout the cash value growth as a way to draw you in as a potential investment.\n7. But the reality is that the growth of those policies are typically extremely poor and most people in the financial sector would instead encourage you to buy a term life policy that would cover whatever you needed to.\n8. So yes these tick tocks you are seeing are accurate however they're using some flawed foundations to share that content with you.\n9. If for example somebody had bought you a whole life policy when you were a child and it has a crude cash value then you most certainly could tap into that but you should not go out and buy a whole life policy with the intention of doing this.",

        "input": "Question: Why is killing sharks and whales heavily frowned upon but catching crabs, fish, and other marine animals by the masses is not?\nAnswer: 1. This is too simplistic a view of the animal kingdom, but has answers.\n2. In general, sharks and whales reproduce slowly, live a long time, and do a lot of work to keep ecosystems under control by eating a lot.\n3. Because of \"reproduce slowly\" and \"eat a lot\", they're more likely to be endangered than a lot of things \"below\" them in the food chain.\n4. So especially when they are endangered, we discourage people from killing them because it has a big impact on the ecosystem.\n5. But crabs?\n6. Very few of them are endangered.\n7.

That tends to go for a lot of aquatic creatures.\n12. Most exist just to be food for other things.\n13. As such, they have huge broods of offspring and the law of large numbers means enough survive to keep the species going.\n14. There are some endangered fish we can't catch, and a lot of areas require fishing licenses and have restrictions on what people can catch without releasing.\n15.

It requires immense temperatures and pressures which you aren't going to get out of conventional explosives.\n10. You can't just have a fuse leading to deuterium and while hydrogen will burn violently when exposed to oxygen it isn't nearly as powerful as conventional chemical explosives.\n11. Even carefully shaped charges using our most powerful conventional chemical explosives aren't going to fuse the material of a warhead.\n12.

The CPU of computers have, hard coded into then, a set of instructions that define the kinds of operations that computer can perform.\n2. For example, adding two numbers.\n3. These instructions are coded in binary.\n4. For example, the instruction to add two numbers in memory (along with an optional constant) might look like:0010000xxxxxyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzwhere the x's represent the location to find the first number.\n5. The y's represent the location to find the second number, the z's represent the third constant, and the 0010000 is what tells the computer that this is an adding operation.\n6. This is not a particularly intuitive representation.\n7. So instead we might want to represent it with something more like language, like:\"add x y z\"but now we need a program that converts \"add x y z\", which we understand, into \"0010000xxxxxyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\", which the computer understands.\n8. So we make a program that does that, directly programming it with machine code.\n9. This is how *assemblers* came into being.\n10.

Edit: did other ancient civilizations have travelers like the Europeans did? If so why do we focus so heavily on European history/advancements in schools?\nAnswer: 1. They did, yes.\n2. A samurai named [hasekura tsunenaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasekura_tsunenaga), for example, traveled east across the pacific, all the way across north America, across the atlantic, visited much of Europe, and returned via colonial-era latin America, for example.\n3. Wiki has a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_explorers); here's a few notables:* [zhang qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhang_qian), a 2nd century Chinese explorer who visited much of western asia and returned to China and is responsible in part for the establishment of the silk road (which would, itself, have hundreds of traveling merchants along its length).\n4. * [zheng he](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zheng_he), who explored much of south asia and east africa from his homeland in China.\n5. * [ibn battuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibn_battuta), a berber who was the most traveled man known in the pre-modern world, who visited almost the entirety of the old world from South africa to Spain to russia to China to India.\n6. He traveled more than 100,000 km in the 1300s, mostly from 1325 to 1347, which means he averaged around 12 km of travel *per day* for more than 20 years in a pre-industrial world.\n7. In addition to these deliberate explorers, you'll find plenty of other people who ended up in cultures wildly different from their own, as with [yasuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yasuke), a slave or servant from Mozambique who ended up in the service of famous Japanese historical figure oda nobunaga.\n8. We hear mostly about the Europeans because (a) you and I are speaking english and therefore are by nature working within a European cultural world and (b) European colonial power made early European explorers particularly important to world history, because they laid the groundwork for the eventual colonization of most of the world by Europe.\n9.

Tldr: government inaction and lobbying by big businessbusinesses have a vested interest in keeping the cost of labor down, because the workers are often the most expensive part of running a business.\n2. So even as the cost of living increases, the average wage tends to remain stagnant.\n3. Minimum wage laws were passed originally to force companies to pay people a living wage, meaning that every employee was making enough money to makes ends meet.\n4. But with inflation the cost of living increases, so the minimum wage has to be increased to compensate.\n5. This idea in the public consciousness that minimum wage jobs are 'starter jobs for young people' is totally wrong and not in the spirit of the laws.\n6. This comes from decades of lobbying from big businesses to convince people of this.\n7. The average age of a person on minimum wage in the us is 35.\n8. Other average wages are tied to the minimum wage, because the average worker is often thought of as working x dollars over minimum.\n9. So as the minimum wage goes up so do other salaries in the lower brackets.\n10. This is why the old argument of \"i work x trade job, if burger flippers get a minimum wage increase and make y dollars an hour that's unfair because that's more than I make\" is asinine, because a minimum wage increase affects salaries all over the pay scale.\n11. So why is the minimum wage so low?\n12. Decades of lobbying have kept the minimum wage low to benefit companies and protect corporate profits.\n13.

Hypothetically, once a memory is encoded into long-term memory, it is there forever.\n3. So when you can't remember something, it's not because it isn't there, but rather that you can't find your way back to that memory.\n4. Think about a memory like a cabin in a dense forest.\n5. If you visit that cabin often, there will be a well worn path to get there and its easy to find your way.\n6. But when you don't visit a memory often, the path becomes overgrown and harder to find.\n7. You may not be able to locate the cabin anymore.\n8. Now, even if we don't visit our cabin often, we can leave ourselves clues on how to get there.\n9. For instance, if you always have delicious smelling pies cooling on the windowsill of your cabin, you can use the smell and the path to get there.\n10.

        "input": "Question: Why were American civilizations so much less advanced than their European colonizers? Despite being around for just as long?\nAnswer: 1. It's not necessarily that they were less advanced.\n2. The aztecs had irrigation and plumbing as well as city infrastructure that was superior to what was seen in Europe at the time.\n3. They didn't have weapons on the same level.\n4. And the trick is that doesn't matter how advanced your art is, how great you are at agriculture and growing plants, what sort of medical advances you may have made, if someone else has better weapons and can conquer you.\n5. Now, part of these you also is that Europe was in a sweet spot that allowed for rapid technological growth compared to most of the rest of the world.\n6. It wasn't just comparatively easier access to metals, but also that the mediterranean sea and many large rivers made rapid communication between different civilizations much easier, and that made it much easier for information to travel and thus improve.\n7. If someone invents something in rome, it was very easy for that knowledge to make it to France, where it could be improved upon.\n8. Likewise, the easier proximity between nations in Europe encouraged wars, which also made them focus a lot more on weapons technology development.\n9. So while there are many ways that the natives of the americas had developed, their weapons technology was nowhere near enough to stand the chance against the Europeans.\n10. That, combined with the impact of diseases that the Europeans brought, since they were more used to keeping domesticated animals, and of us getting more diseases from those, meant that the native americans didn't stand a chance.",

The author does not offer a historical precedent or context for the assertion, leaving the point moot. For example, superior weapons were important during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. However, while Cortes's force had superior weapons they lacked the numbers needed for total conquest of the Aztecs. Instead, Cortes relied on divisions among the peoples of Central Mexico, exploiting these to form alliances against the Mexicas (leaders of the Aztec empire) - thus, the conquest of the Aztecs was less about sheer force through advanced weaponry and more about superior strategy both militarily and politically. Furthermore, the aspect of cultural traditions was also a deciding factor in the success of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs - the latter allowed Cortes to reinforce his lieutenant and commander of the Spanish garrison outside Tenochtitlan, Alvarado, resulting in a strengthening of the Spanish line at a point when they were themselves divided and weakened. The Aztecs allowed such a thing to happen because of their ceremonial tradition that war must be fought en-masse and head-on, not through more Anglo/euro-centric concepts like 'divide and conquer'.

[Incomplete] Reasons: While factually sound, there needs to be a better-expressed correlation between the relativity of proximity and increased warfare to technological development. Is conflict the result of 'proximity', and how? Border disputes, trade, and the claim to natural resources are involved in the nature of conflict. How true is this to historical examples? Are there often broader regional disputes that spill over into war because of contiguity? For example, during the 15th century AD, was war and disputes between the states constituting the Holy Roman Empire the result of their proximity to one other or the specific nature of a dominating driving factor, such as the controversial coronation of Wenceslas IV as Holy Roman Emperor - was the subsequent war that followed, upon King Sigismund of Hungary's invasion of Bohemia, the result of Wesceslas's disagreements with the imperial nobility, or was it the instigation by the Pope in Rome? In other words, how centralized was 'proximity'?

When I workout again, I gain mental clarity, become more motivated to take on the day, and like 75% of the self-deprecating thoughts I experience go away. Why does this happen to me? What's the science behind this?\nAnswer: 1. Biologically, exercise causes your brain to release neurotransmitters (most importantly dopamine and endorphins).\n2. Neurotransmitters basically carry the chemicals that are used to trigger certain feelings, and distributes them throughout your brain.\n3. That being said, endorphins can physically lower feelings of stress and pain and increase mood and energy.\n4. Dopamine contributes to feelings of pleasure, reward, and satisfaction.\n5. Exercise is among the healthiest and most natural ways to trigger the release of these neurotransmitters in your brain.\n6. There are also a few much more simple ways that it could help clear up negative feelings.\n7. For one, it feels good to be productive.\n8. Exercise is productive.\n9. When you exercise, you might feel a sense of purpose.\n10. And fulfilling that goal gives you an immediate sense of accomplishment for how hard you're working.\n11. It also loosens your muscles that are probably otherwise tense from feelings of anxiety and depression while forcing you to breathe more steadily.\n12.

        "input": "Question: Canada is raising interest again to prevent a recession. How does this work?\nAnswer: 1. First you have to realize it\u2019s all related to inflation.\n2. Inflation simply means that goods and services cost more now than they used to.\n3. Next you have to understand the law of supply and demand and how they relate to pricing.\n4. If supply is high and demand is low, prices go down.\n5. If demand is high and supply is low, prices go up.\n6. Combining these two, we can understand that prices are going up, because demand for those good and services is going up.\n7. So how does changing interest rates affect this?\n8. Well when interest rates are low, companies and people tend to take on more loans, since they are able to get that money cheaply.\n9. With more money to spend, they want to make use of that money, so they buy goods and services.\n10. But as already discussed, that means more demand, which means prices go up even more.\n11. But we don\u2019t want prices to go up now, we want prices to go down.\n12. The only way to make prices go down is to either increase the supply more than the demand (something that a government can\u2019t do in a capitalist society) or decrease demand.\n13. How can they decrease demand?\n14. Raise interest rates.\n15. With higher interest rates, companies and individuals do not borrow as much.\n16. As interest rates get higher, not only are they not borrowing as much, they are instead saving more and more of the money they do have.\n17. So raising interest rates lowers the amount of money being spent on goods and services, which lowers demand, which lowers prices.",

        "input": "Question: How do ozone machine get rid of odors and why is it dangerous to use without property ppe?\nAnswer: 1. Oxygen is a *very* grabby element.\n2. It wants to hold onto electrons very tightly, which is why it forms very strong bonds with things like carbon.\n3. Oxygen essentially can't exist on its own, it's too reactive.\n4. So, oxygen in the air is mostly in the form o2, where two oxygen atoms are sharing their electrons with each other.\n5. However, it really *doesn't* like sharing its electrons with other oxygen atoms, because they all want to grab the electrons, like a game of tug of war.\n6. So when you put *three* oxygen atoms together (ozone, o3) they **really** don't want to share, even a little bit.\n7. They'll share with o2 well enough but a third oxygen atom just is not welcome to that party.\n8. As soon as the ozone comes into contact with anything else, one of the oxygen atoms will pop off and grab onto that other thing, hard.\n9. Oxygen grabs harder than almost any other element, so if the oxygen grabs onto an atom, the atom may have to let go of an atom that it was holding.\n10. In this way, the \"lone\" single oxygen atom tears apart other molecules.\n11. If that molecule is a smelly odor-causing molecule, it gets torn up and probably doesn't cause an odor anymore.\n12. If you just have a bunch of o2, that will still kind of happen but it takes a little more energy to get the two oxygen atoms to fall apart.\n13. Even if they don't like sharing, if one oxygen atom leaves, the other would be alone which is too unstable, so they tend to stay together unless both of them get bind to new atoms.\n14. If you have a bunch of free oxygen atoms, they will immediate react with each other and pair up, or react to whatever you're trying to hold them in an burn/explode.\n15. Ozone splits that difference - stable enough to carry around that extra oxygen that can react to things, but not so unstable that it reacts before it has a chance to get there.\n16. It's dangerous because ozone doesn't particularly care what it's reacting with.\n17. If it gets in your lungs, it'll do the same thing to all the molecules in your lungs that it will do to odor molecules in the air.\n18. If it gets into your blood, it'll do the same thing to molecules in your blood.\n19. It's just not a great thing to get in your body.\n20. It's fine if the levels in the air are low enough - after all, as long as it's reacting to stuff in the air then it's destroying itself before much of it can get to you.\n21. If the levels get too high, though, enough of it will survive long enough to get to you, and then you have a problem.",

It\u2019s a programmed form of cell death that does not only occur in damaged cells.\n8. It triggers it in healthy cells too.\n9. Like most things in medicine, whether it is good or bad is a matter of degree and circumstance.\n10. The endocannabinoids may be helpful in protecting against long term damage from cannabis use, and *also* damaging in other ways.\n11. Even the \u201cbad\u201d effects - like immune suppression ( it triggers cell death very efficiently in certain kinds of immune cells ) - can be beneficial in the right circumstances.\n12.

Also a lot of their society is based on confucianism which is a religion that originated in China. How was Chinese culture able to make such a big impact in those countries?\nAnswer: 1. Because it was the only major culture there.\n2. Japan is an island and korea is a peninsula.\n3. So on one side you have China and on all other sides you have vast ocean.\n4.

How is that not the most unhealthy and disgusting thing ever, to inhale people's intestinal solids? Same with cooking something? Like, if I had the superpower of being able to see microscopic stuff, I would just see a cloud of beef particles for a square half mile around the burger joint that always smells so good when I drive nearby it?\nAnswer: 1. Anything that is matter has mass.\n2. A fart or a smell is just molecules like the oxygen or nitrogen in the air.\n3. In the case of farts, most of the gas (\\~75%) is hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane.\n4. Those don't have much of a smell, but there's also usually a tiny bit (<1%) of sulphur-containing gases that stink terribly.\n5. They're gases, not poop dust, so particles might be a bit misleading in this context.\n6. We're not talking \"intestinal solids\".\n7. Farts range from 10 - 400 ml in volume, and the fart gas happens to weigh roughly 1 g/l, so a fart weights 10-400 mg.\n8. By comparison, a grain of rice weighs about 29 mg.\n9.

The chromium oxide is very tough and a thin, invisible layer seals the surface of the metal off, so no more air can get in.\n4. Regular iron corrodes to form iron oxide, which is rust.\n5.

A high-energy particle zipping through the body can easily break molecular bonds, destroying all sorts of structures needed to keep us alive and functioning properly.\n3. A lower energy particle is much less capable of doing significant damage.\n4.

Diet soda's are just as corrosive as regular soda (they contain phosphoric acid) so even when sugar free they are still pretty bad for your teeth.\n2. Even though they contain no sugar and few if any calories they still mess with your metabolism and have been connected with weight gain in a number of studies.\n3.

Is the conversion instant , gradual or do you have to wait for all dopamine to be converted to norepinephrine ?\nAnswer: 1. Typical medications for adhd don't increase production of dopamine.\n2. They act on mobilizing what you already make, getting it into action between nerves.\n3. Medications that actually increase dopamine synthesis are instead used for parkinson's, where there's actually a loss of dopamine-producing cells.\n4. They don't work well for adhd.\n5. ---------------------------------------------edit: some more information as there's often a lot of curiosity around similar questions.\n6. Basically, while many psychiatric problems seem to involve some sort of alterations in how the brain uses various neurotransmitters to function, none are as simple as \"too little of this\" or \"too much of that.\n7. \" (classic narcolepsy, on the other hand, actually does involve destruction of cells that produce a neurotransmitter called orexin or hypocretin; parkinson's, as above, involves loss of dopamine neurons.\n8. That said, both can involve psychiatric symptoms.\n9. )dopamine in particular is a curious chemical, which the brain and body use for many different functions, and where the timing/size/location of a dopamine signal can make a lot of difference.\n10. For instance, unless you're breastfeeding or taking certain medications right now, dopamine is constantly, 24/7/365, telling part of your brain not to fire up milk production.\n11. (you've been taking it for granted, all these years.\n12. ) in other areas, dopamine has curious roles involve movement, reward/prediction, and motivation.\n13. As you can imagine, it's very important that a signal related to movement or reward be timed correctly.\n14. Fundamentally, the brain is always trying to figure out \"was that thing I just did good or not, and would the benefit of doing the same thing or another thing be worth the effort and risk?\n15. \" it's sometimes described as a pleasure molecule but that's probably not very accurate, and other neurotransmitters probably have a stronger role.\n16. Researchers have modeled adhd around failure of the frontal cortex (the part of the brain that's supposed to take charge and connect behavior to goals) to use neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine to adequately rein in the rest of the brain, probably with related alterations in reward processing.\n17.

        "input": "Question: Why are binoculars and riflescopes expressed in magnification, but camera lenses are expressed in focal length?\nAnswer: 1. The practice of using focal length for camera lenses originated from the first bellows cameras.\n2. It let you know how far you needed to extend the lens designed for a specific sized image circle for a distant object to be in sharpest focus at the focal plane.\n3. When lens mounts replaced bellows and lenses started using multiple elements the industry should have shifted to magnification or field of view, but it didn't.\n4. This practice continued until long after it was practical or meaningful to describe a lens by focal length.\n5. The focal length is directly related to the size of the imaging circle at the focal plane.\n6. The focal length numbers you see are typically referred to as \"35mm equivalent\" meaning that this is what the focal length would have been if it was a lens for a 35mm system.\n7. Lots of modern digital cameras have much smaller image sensors than 35mm.\n8. The iphone's actual focal length is less than 3mm but it is only ever referred to as a focal length of 26mm as that would be its \"35mm equivalent.\n9. \"today all lenses have multiple complex lens elements that allow the designer to place the focal plane at any desired distance from the front of the lens.\n10. This means that in practice focal length means literally nothing even on 35mm systems.\n11. I have a 35mm lens that is much longer than my 85mm lens.\n12. Also note that the imaging circle for 35mm systems isn't even 35mm because of course it isn't.\n13. The diagonal of 35mm film is 43.\n14. 27mm, so the image circle has to be at least that big to cover the full frame of the film.\n15. So what does focal length really mean?\n16. It tells you how far from the focal plane the front of the lens would need to be if it were a single element lens and the imaging circle needs to be 44mm and you wanted to focus at a distant object.\n17. Implicit in all of this is the thing you really want to know - the field of view of the lens.\n18. **tl;dr: camera lenses use \"focal length\" for century-old legacy reasons, none of which make any sense today but it still kind of works because of the relationship to field of view and the standardization of the 35mm format.\n19. Binoculars and rifle scopes use magnification and aperture because it's the sane thing to do.\n20. **",

        "input": "Question: Is inflation inevitable in all successful economies? Throughout history, has there ever been a society that maintained 0% inflation for a long term while still maintaining a good quality of life?\nAnswer: 1. To answer that question you need to understand what inflation is exactly.\n2. Currency and wealth are two different things.\n3. Wealth is stuff of value for human, either a product, a natural resource or a service.\n4. Currency is just something that help trade wealth.\n5. There is a relationship of supply and demand between the two.\n6. The supply is the currency and the demand is the wealth, because the more wealth you have the more you want to trade it with others.\n7. In general, wealth increase over time.\n8. The population increase so more worker, the technology and education increase so we are more productive, etc.\n9. So this mean that if demand (wealth) increase, but the supply (currency) stay the same, then the value of the currency will increase, which would be deflation.\n10. But if we add currency to the economy faster than the wealth increase, then we get more supply than demand, which lead to a decrease in the value of the supply (currency), we call that inflation.\n11. So as a country you can decide how much currency you want to add to the economy to control like a valve how much deflation or inflation you want.\n12. But unlike a valve, this is a very complex and dynamic problem.\n13. You can try to estimate how much wealth will increase, but you will never estimate exactly.\n14. You also can't simply add an exact amount of currency in the economy, you need to add it indirectly (too complicated to explain here).\n15. So even if you wanted to stay at 0% inflation, that would just be impossible.\n16. So usually countries try to target about 2% inflation.\n17. That way with natural variation you should vary between 0 and 4% inflation, which are all relatively healthy level of inflation.\n18. You don't want to go into deflation long term or too high of an inflation.\n19. The other advantage of targeting 2% is that a little bit of inflation is actually good.\n20. It incentivize people to invest their money instead of keeping it.\n21. Money invested is money that do work and that's good for economic growth.\n22. So no it would be physically impossible to keep your inflation at 0%, but even if it was possible that wouldn't be good for economic growth.",

I had a reading for my mba class tonight that was a piece written by jeff immelt, former CEO of general electric, right before he left the company. The class discussion was probably the most animated discussion of the whole class so far. [the article](https://hbr.org/2017/09/inside-ges-transformation) on its own merits didn't seem controversial, as they were standard change management material, but emotions ran high during discussion, and I was confused.\nAnswer: 1. Jack welch created ge finance, which provided in-house finance for ge products.\n2. Ge finance was *wildly* profitable, but there was a lack of understanding of the cause of this success among ge's leadership.\n3. They viewed ge finance as being the entity driving the company and invested heavily in it, while neglecting investment in ge's industrial arm.\n4. This set up for a situation where chronic underinvestment caused ge's product line to stall and quality to drop.\n5. By the time that welch left, he'd sort of set up a time bomb where ge products were rapidly becoming obsolete trash.\n6. Because ge finance's business was almost exclusively financing purchases of ge products, when ge's product line started to tank, ge finance tanked as well.\n7. This wouldn't have necessarily been a problem, because one thing welch did quite well was to turn ge into a major exporter and ge had built up a **huge** pile of overseas cash.\n8. Immelt inherited that cash pile and could have used it to revamp ge's product line.\n9. He didn't.\n10. An unwillingness to pay us tax on overseas profit caused immelt to refuse to invest the money in us manufacturing.\n11. At the same time, a fear of foreign countries nationalizing ge overseas investments also stopped immelt from investing in overseas production (and this was a well founded fear in the early 2000's - backdoor nationalizations were common at the time).\n12. So instead of investing the cash into ge's business, immelt just let it sit in foreign bank accounts, doing absolutely nothing, and most of ge's business just sort of rotted away under him.",

In the us (and some other nations), the legal system is set up with the presumption that an a person accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty.\n2. Thus, it would be wrong to force people to possibly be imprisoned--maybe for years, waiting for trial--if they are actually innocent.\n3. However, if accused people are simply arrested and released, many do not return to court to face the criminal accusations (whether they are innocent or guilty).\n4. So, a bail system was developed, so that a person had to provide some kind of security that he would return to court.\n5. If the person on bail does not return, the court claims the money, which can then be used to help track down the person and bring them before the court.",

But was it possible to book a ticket for flight from iran from United states so quick without the internet?\nAnswer: 1. So, just because the internet didn't exist doesn't mean computers didn't.\n2. Back in.\n3. .\n4. .\n5. 1960?\n6. The sabre system was developed for American airlines.\n7. Essentially every booking agent had a dumb terminal into a mainframe computer.\n8. The airline would have a 1-800 #, or they would have an actual booking office in larger cities and at the airports they serviced.\n9. Travel agents who wanted to offer that airline, could subscribe to the airline's booking system and they'd literally plug their terminals over leased phone lines into the airline's mainframe.\n10. Immediately, every other airline went to ibm and the other big computer companies to develop competing systems.\n11. Over time, each system was bought or replaced by one or two of the major players; each surviving system generalized so it could service multiple airlines, have different features, planes, rewards programs etc.\n12. But same idea - you'd have a computer with a terminal into \"the mainframe\" and you were either an airline employee in a call center or at a desk somewhere, or a travel agency who subscribed to the service.\n13. In the internet days, the leased phone lines and dumb terminals gave way to remote clients over dialup or isdn and eventually into app-like smart clients, web delivered database apps.",

If i'm a doctor, I could prescribe something wrong or do a surgery wrong and kill someone.\n3. If i'm a car manufacturer, I could build a car that occasionally catches on fire and burns the people inside to death.\n4. If I pour concrete sidewalks, I could do a bad job and create a substantial tripping hazard (obviously not as bad as killing someone, but still a problem that costs more to deal with than the profit I make from that single job).\n5. &#x200b;in order to make sure that the people aren't completely screwed when they're victims of big problems that come from a business like that, states require that those businesses keep a big pile of money available to pay out if there is a big problem.\n6. That big pile of money is too big for most companies to keep sitting unused all the time, so the businesses buy surety bonds.\n7. Those aren't the same kind of bonds as \"stocks and bonds\" on wall street.\n8.

        "input": "Question: How do torrents work? Isn't a torrent just, like. . . Directly sharing a file from your pc? What's all this business about \"seeding\" and \"leeching\"?\nAnswer: 1. It is basically like directly sharing, but not quite.\n2. A file (it can be anything) is separated into many smaller pieces, each getting a special name.\n3. The torrent basically holds this information and the instructions on how to assemble the smaller pieces into one piece, the original file.\n4. This instruction (a torrent) is coupled with additional information which keeps track of various computers across the internet which have the same torrent and which pieces of the original file they have.\n5. This additional information is called trackers.\n6. When you download a specific torrent and run it using software made to read it, the software knows what smaller pieces of the larger file you lack (when you begin you lack all of them) and it checks which computers have those smaller pieces.\n7. Then it downloads the smaller pieces from any available computer which has them.\n8. Once it has all the pieces, they are assembled into the original file.\n9. Seeders is the name for the computers which the entire file and thus all the smaller pieces.\n10. Leechers is the name for the computers which do not have the entire file, but rather any amount of the smaller pieces.\n11. The benefit of the system is that you can download any piece from any computer which has it, be they seeders or leechers, as long as those computers are currently running the torrent software and are connected to the internet.\n12. So, in short, torrents help by distributing a file to as many people as possible and allow anyone to download that file by taking pieces from everyone until they have the whole thing.\n13. This way nobody is dependant on one place that holds the file.\n14. If someone disconnects or deletes the file it is still available to download from the other people who have it.\n15. Of course, if everyone who has the complete file were to delete it, nobody would be able to get the full file anymore.",

It fully makes sense that it\u2019s complicated to get the texture right, but why have I never been able to find a product that tastes like real bacon, for example? What makes it more than just the right combination of chemicals for a bacon flavour?\nAnswer: 1. Imagine you\u2019re a textile maker, and you want to make a lovely shirt that feels just like silk, but you want to make it with leather.\n2. There are ways you can treat the leather to make it easier to turn into a shirt, but no matter what it\u2019s gonna be really hard to make it look and feel just like silk.\n3. It comes down to the fact that you\u2019re using different materials with different properties, so the more you want to change the material\u2019s properties the harder it is to actually make it happen.\n4. It\u2019s the same kind of thing with plants and animal products - they\u2019re different materials with different properties.\n5. Plants can still give you the same nutrition as meat, just like leather can still give you the same items of clothing as silk - but the properties of flavor, look, and feel are going to be different because they\u2019re made of different materials.\n6. There are a lot of people working on some really interesting ways to make plants taste more like meat, and it\u2019s definitely improving, but it may not ever be 100% the same - because you can only alter materials so much before you start hitting diminishing returns (which is maybe beyond a 5 year olds grasp, but whatever).\n7. Speaking as someone who\u2019s been a vegetarian for a few years now, i\u2019ve always preferred just making vegetables taste really good instead of trying to make them approximate meat.\n8.

It cost me $500 to get that TV from the manufacturer, and I get $500 profit from the sale of each TV as a result.\n3. I normally sell 10 tvs a month, and make $5,000.\n4. But on black friday, I lowered the cost of the TV to $800.\n5. It still cost me $500 to get that TV from the manufacturer, so I will only earn $300 for each TV I sell.\n6. But because of the sale that day, a lot more people are going to rush into the store and buy them.\n7. I will sell 20 tvs on black friday, and make $6,000 in a single day.\n8. I don't want to have that low of a price all the time, but every once in a while having an extra low price will dramatically encourage sales.\n9. Because it's a rare occasion, I will get more people willing to buy that TV on that day then if I just lowered the price in general.\n10. Likewise, if someone comes to my store to buy the cheap tv, they might also end up buying more accessories as well.\n11. They intended to just get a tv, but will also leave with a sound bar too.\n12. So that sound bar might only have a very mild discount, but because the person feels they saved money on the deal overall, they feel okay with also buying a sound bar.\n13. These contribute to making it very profitable to hold deals on black friday.\n14. You might only discount a few items, you might have something rare that will encourage people to go to your store and they will leave buying other things as well.\n15.

Like, if I fill up a glass 3/4 of ice and the rest with water, the glass is still at the same water level even after the ice has melted. You would think the water would take up more volume once in its liquid state\u2026.\nAnswer: 1. > you would think the water would take up more volume once in its liquid state\u2026.\n2. You might think that, and most materials that would be true, but water has the rare quality that its solid state actually takes up **more** volume than its liquid state.\n3. This is after all why it floats, as it displaces more volume than its weight in liquid water.\n4. As for why the water level doesn't change, anything floating in water will displace its weight equivalent in volume of water.\n5. So if a ship weighs 100 tons it would displace a volume of water equal to 100 tons; if its hull isn't big enough to do that then it will sink!\n6. Ice takes up slightly more volume than liquid water so a bit of ice pokes up out of the water as it floats, but when it melts it reduces in volume and takes up precisely the volume it displaced meaning the water level doesn't change.",
        "output": "1. [Complete]\n2. [Incomplete] Reasons: An explanation of why this is the case would be beneficial - liquid water is more dense as the liquid molecules of H2O are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonding. This is when there are polar interactions between the slightly negatively charged oxygen atoms and the slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms in water molecules (opposites attract). The converse is also true, and repulsive interactions occur between similarly charged ends. In the solid state, the more rigid structure means that the water molecules are more spread out since they would equally want to minimize the repulsion between positive-positive or negative-negative ends of the molecules. However, in the liquid state, the molecules are free-flowing and therefore less spread out (therefore more dense).\n3. [Incomplete] Reasons: The answer would be improved if this definition of density was explained - Ice floats because it is less dense than the liquid water it is in. This means that the molecules in the ice take up more volume than the equivalent number of molecules of liquid water. Imagine a rock - it is the opposite of ice, as a rock is more dense than ice, and liquid water, and therefore it sinks.\n4. [Complete]\n5. [Complete]\n6. [Complete]"

A downside is that very bright lights like the sun get focused onto the delicate retina so intensely, it causes damage.\n4. Insects, on the other hand, have compound eyes that don't use large lenses.\n5. These eyes have an excellent field of view and ability to detect motion, but aren't so sensitive to light.\n6.

The rising sun flag is older and not exclusively associated with that particular time in history.\n2. It is also not outright banned or outlaws in Japan or even places like korea or China.\n3. The Nazi flag despite incorporating an ancient buddhist symbol is almost exclusively associated with the Nazis and outright banned in Germany and several other European countries.\n4. Companies that make money in places in Europe will want to avoid legal trouble and controversy by self censoring its use.\n5. There is less pressure along those line to do the same for the imperial Japanese flag.\n6. If it were entirely based on body count, you would have trouble with the british flag too, but unlike a confederate flag or a Nazi flag a modern british flag is not exclusively associated with past crimes against humanity and broadcasting a desire to commit more of them.\n7. It is also going to cause far fewer people to complain who have enough money to make the companies care about their complains.\n8. Justice and the amount of past wrongs don't figure into it as much as money.\n9.

The imperial Japanese flag may be a sign that someone is racists and nationalists, but does not quite carry the same implied threat of overthrowing the government installing a dictatorship and committing a genocide.\n12.

The starch from the rice allows the water to form bubbles, but not very strongly, so typically the high pressure in the bubble will cause them to burst immediately, but when the lid is on the pot, the hot vapor and air increase the pressure in the air in the pot and lowers the imbalance in pressure, meaning the ambient air pressure is similar to the pressure inside that bubbles, so they don't burst.\n2. Opening the lid lowers the pressure, creates an imbalance and causes the bubbles to burst.",
        "output": "1. [Incomplete] Reasons: This fact is incomplete as it does not describe how starch helps in forming bubbles. In fact, starch molecules absorb water and swell up when boiled, trapping air to form bubbles. These bubbles rise when heated due to the expansion of trapped air.\n2. [Complete]"

The rise in borrowing costs has been mentioned which is true, but it also represents a bit of a paradigm shift that was a surprise to markets.\n2. The Japanese central bank had been keeping rates effectively zero whilst other central banks had been rising to manage inflation.\n3. Japan has not seen the same inflation as most other markets, for a number of reasons.\n4. Japan\u2019s monetary policy remains very accommodative, but this is a move in the opposite direction, albeit somewhat marginal.\n5. The break in rhetoric from the bank of Japan caught market participants but surprise and markets reacted accordingly; bonds fell to adjust to the new rate regime expectations, equity markets overall fell, financial stocks rose, and the yen rallied.\n6. The australian stock market fell sharply as a flow on effect - there is a common trade (\u201ccarry trade\u201d) whereby you borrow in Japan cheaply to invest in higher yielding markets like Australia.\n7.

Carb emission standards for aftermarket catalytic converters are more elaborate than the epa standards for aftermarket catalytic converters and requires a more extensive warranty than the epa.\n4. As a result, carb-compliant catalytic converters typically use an enhanced combination of washcoat technology and higher precious metal load to meet the stricter emissions conversions standard.\n5.
