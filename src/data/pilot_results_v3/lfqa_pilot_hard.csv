"ANSWER2:
A ""muscle knotting up"" is called a ""tetanic contraction"", which means the muscle contracted by a constant stream if nerve impulses telling it to do so. the causes can vary from phycological to chemical to pathological. psychological reasons usually involve stresses and panic. the most common chemical reason it happens is because of a buildup of lactic acid inside of the muscle tissue. the act of contracting a muscle is mostly a chemical reaction started by a nerve impulse to where the muscle tissue uses glucose, then releases lactic acid into the blood to be carried away and (hopefully) neutralized. if your blood flow cannot move it away fast enough, the lactic acid builds up in the muscle tissue and makes the nerve impulses go haywire."	This part is linguistically weak and confuses the reader.

"ANSWER2:
One of the early things your immune system does as it's developing is to ""learn"" what things it encounters are *you*. unfortunately, this isn't perfect, either from the very beginning or later in life, and it'll occasionally fail to delete immune cells that target particular proteins and the like on your own cells."	The sentence is not well written and has grammatical issues.
