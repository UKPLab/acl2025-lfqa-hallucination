Answer 2 is also correct but gives only one reason and builds the answer around it.	model_answer	human_answer	Why does alcohol make your throat or stomach feel warm when drinking?	There are a few reasons why alcohol might make your throat or stomach feel warm. first, alcohol is a solvent, which means it can dissolve other substances. when you drink alcohol, it can break down the barrier between your stomach and your throat, causing a burning sensation. second, alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach, causing inflammation. this can also lead to a burning feeling. finally, when you drink alcohol, your blood vessels dilate, or widen. this increased blood flow can cause a feeling of warmth.	The perception of warmth internally is caused by the fact that your interior tissues are sensitive and alcohol is a corrosive chemical: it literally burns your tissues. the perception of warmth outside your body is caused by blood vessel dilation. heat is picked up from muscle activity by blood and distributed throughout the body. when your blood vessels dilate (due to being to hot, consuming alcohol, or a series of other reasons), the heat leaves through the skin.

A muscle knot, also called a trigger point, is a tight area within muscle tissue that causes pain in other parts of the body. the knots often form in response to muscle overuse or injury. muscle knots can also be caused by psychological stress.when a muscle knot forms, the muscle fibers in the area tighten and contract. this can lead to the formation of a small, hard lump. the knots can be very painful, and they can cause muscle weakness and reduced range of motion.heat can help to loosen the muscle fibers and reduce pain. ice can also be helpful in reducing pain and inflammation. myofascial release therapy is a type of massage that can be helpful in treating muscle knots.	"A ""muscle knotting up"" is called a ""tetanic contraction"", which means the muscle contracted by a constant stream if nerve impulses telling it to do so. the causes can vary from phycological to chemical to pathological. psychological reasons usually involve stresses and panic. the most common chemical reason it happens is because of a buildup of lactic acid inside of the muscle tissue. the act of contracting a muscle is mostly a chemical reaction started by a nerve impulse to where the muscle tissue uses glucose, then releases lactic acid into the blood to be carried away and (hopefully) neutralized. if your blood flow cannot move it away fast enough, the lactic acid builds up in the muscle tissue and makes the nerve impulses go haywire.

Phlegm/mucus is normally a layer of protection in our lungs and breathing tubes, but when we are ill our bodies often produce too much of it. it can then collect in the throat around the vocal cords which are the tiny folds of tissue that vibrate together when we speak or sing. coughing or throat clearing is basically slamming the vocal cords together so they push the excess mucus away and back up into the mouth so it can be either spat out or swallowed down and got rid of using our stomach juices. so it generally feels good to get rid of it, but unfortunately until we get better, more mucus quickly arrives to take its place and that's why we keep on coughing.	When you have a cold, your throat can become inflamed and sore. this is because of the increased mucus production and the irritation from all the coughing. clearing your throat helps to remove some of the mucus and gives temporary relief from the irritation. however, it is important to not overdo it as this can further irritate the throat and make the cough worse.

"Sperm cells are able to be frozen and thawed because they are able to dehydrate themselves and protect their dna. when sperm is frozen, the water inside the cells turn to ice crystals which can puncture and damage the cells. in order to prevent this, the sperm is dehydrated which removes most of the water from the cells. this makes the cells more resistant to damage from the ice crystals. when the sperm is thawed, the water is able to reenter the cells and the sperm is able to ""come back to life."""	The reason why cells usually die when frozen is that the water contained in them forms ice crystals with sharp edges and points which also take up more space than the water they have formed from. these crystals destroy the internal cell structures and its outer membrane, so the cell basically is burst open. sperm cells are very small and have lower water content than other human cell types and for this reason they are more capable of surviving freezing. to improve the odds of survival, cryoprotectors like glycerol are also added which inhibit crystal growth. another, even better technique is vitrification which uses super fast cooling to extremely low temperatures (like down to almost -200 °c in less than a second). this makes the water pass through to a glass-like solid state without forming crystals. this is the preferred method for egg cell and embryo cryopreservation,  because those, unlike sperm cells, are few and hard to come by.

Answer:  your body immediately sends out rescuers in the form of fluids - those extra fluids in the tissues compress the small blood vessels/ capillaries.  what you’re feeling is the pulse rate of your heart as the blood flows through the compressed area.  you’re more aware of it bc the pain signals have your attention drawn to that spot.  this is similar to when you have your pulse taken, it’s felt by slightly compressing a vessel.  try it out by pressing two fingers against the visible vessels on the inside of your wrist - push slightly down and toward the thumb side…	The pain doesn't actually come in waves, it just feels that way because the pain receptors get fatigued.pain receptors are neurons that send signals to the brain to let us know that something is wrong. however, these neurons can only send so many signals at once, and they can get tired. so, the pain comes in pulses because the neurons are taking breaks in between sending signals.

20	0725d873-e32c-4c8e-bbcf-8e3eb6a8a0cd.txt	rachneet	Answer 2	The answer 2 addresses the actual health benefits of exercise and explains why sweating is not the only thing that happens when we exercise. On the other hand, the answer 1 is not sufficient since it does not list any actual health benefits.	model_answer	human_answer	Exercise makes you sweat. heat makes you sweat. so does sweating even just from heat have any health benefits?	Yes, sweating from heat does have health benefits. when your body temperature rises, your body releases sweat to help cool itself down. this process helps regulate your body temperature and keep you from overheating.	There are some minor benefits however the primary benefit of exercise is not the sweat, it's the building of muscle, the increased heart rate, and all the usual stuff. you don't get healthier from reg exercise *because you sweat*, you get the benefits *and you sweat*.

Also, the answer 1 gives a more in-depth answer by explaining the biology behind the oxidants.	human_answer	model_answer	I keep seeing antioxidant foods portrayed as good and healthy, but what are oxidants and why is oxidation bad for the body?and are there any benefits to oxidants?	Many necessary biological processes create atoms or molecules called radicals. a radical is an atom or molecule that has an unbound valence electron. that electron wants to become bound. in doing so, it can cause damage to parts of our cells, including dna (look up the free radical theory of aging). oxidants are a type of radical, usually either a single oxygen atom or a hydroxyl radical. anti-oxidants bind with these radicals and neutralize them	Antioxidants are important because they protect our cells from damage. the body produces oxidants as a byproduct of normal metabolism, and exposure to tobacco smoke, pollution, and other environmental toxins also can increase the level of oxidants in the body. when these levels become too high, they can damage cells, leading to conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and arthritis.

"Sleep isn't as simple as ""rest"" for you brain. your body does ""rest"" all the cells are metabolize all the time. what goes on in your brain is more like the night times at a bit office. the major executives and engineers and analysis are are gone, but the building is still active. the night janitors coming in to clean up an office, the interns staying late to finish filing, the it guys updating the servers, security guard doing this rounds, etc. it's not resting, it's doing the stuff that your brain wasn't doing when you were awake."
