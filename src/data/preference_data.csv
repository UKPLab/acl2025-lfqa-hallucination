You would think the resolution is already ""maxed out"", how does this improve things?"	When you render a video game at a resolution higher than your monitor's resolution, it's called supersampling. It makes the picture more crisp because it essentially takes multiple pixel samples from the higher-resolution image and averages them to create a more detailed and accurate representation of the original image on your lower-resolution monitor. This process helps to smooth out jagged edges and improve overall image quality, like how combining paint colors can create a smoother gradient. By rendering at a higher resolution first and then downsampling, it can reduce common visual artifacts such as aliasing or pixelation, making the final image look better.	"It's called supersampling and basically gives the computer more options for what to render for any given pixel. If you ""render"" at a higher resolution so that each final pixel is 4 pixels in the supersample then the computer gets 4 reference points for what color that pixel could be instead of just one. It can then average those 4 values and get a cleaner value for that final pixel. When you have high contrast areas (black against white for example) the computer can pick a cleaner average between the two areas (shades of gray) instead of only choosing between white and black."

Download sites have a wait time before the download begins as a way to encourage users to pay for their premium service, manage server load, and generate revenue through ads. Here's a breakdown of these reasons:1. Premium service: by creating a waiting time, download sites create an incentive for users to purchase their premium service. The premium service often allows users to bypass the wait time, offering a faster and more convenient experience. This helps the site generate revenue to keep the site running. 2. Server load management: download sites usually serve many users simultaneously, which could put a strain on their servers. By introducing a wait time, they can manage the server load and ensure that users aren't experiencing too much lag or disruptions during the download process. 3. Ad revenue: while users are waiting for their download to begin, they usually see ads displayed on the site. This waiting time gives users more exposure to those ads, increasing the chances that they might click on them. This, in turn, generates additional revenue for the site. In summary, download sites use a wait time before the download begins to encourage users to upgrade to their premium service, manage their server load, and generate ad revenue to keep the site operational.	"So your eyeballs absorb some ads. Or, hopefully, you get impatient and click the ""download now! "" button which immediately downloads some type of custom ""fast download manager installerywhatsit"" which will install six browsers, eleven internet explorer toolbars (even though you don't even have it), an antivirus program no one has ever heard of, and eleventy billion adware things turning your computer into a dumpster fire. Its not like madge, the blue haired librarian of the internet has to toddle off to some dusty backroom with a stepladder and dig that file out of ""the archives"" (a bankers box miss-labelled ""iomega zip drivers 1997""). ""oooh. Dearie me, I haven't served _that_ file since the nixon administration! ""at best, the file you want isn't a more popular one, so its not in the forward caches or already seeded amongst all the cdn caches, but unless that file/web server is run on a sock puppet nothing should take more than 2-3 seconds to start slinging you bytes."

Chatgpt detection software works by analyzing textual patterns and language use to determine if the text was generated by an AI like chatgpt. Essentially, these programs compare the input text with known characteristics of ai-generated text to come to a conclusion. Ai-generated text often has distinct features that set it apart from human-written text, such as unusual or repetitive word usage, odd sentence structures, and lack of coherence or consistency in ideas. The detection software uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify these patterns. For example, it may compare the text's style, vocabulary, and grammar with a database of human-written text and ai-generated text. If the input closely matches the ai-generated text, the software concludes that it was likely created by an AI like chatgpt. Overall, text detection software makes educated guesses about the origin of a text based on its language patterns and characteristics, thus helping to distinguish between human-created and ai-generated content.	"Anomaly detection is the machine learning method to detect unusual spikes in activity: think about a sleep graph, for example, that has random spikes along the line. In some sense, there's a regular pattern to the spikes, but sometimes a really big spike might come out of nowhere. An anomaly detection machine finds those outliers that don't match the pattern/rhythm. In chatgpt language models, the model's language output has a high degree of regularity: there aren't many random ""spikes"" of outlier language. That is, it's *too* clean and uniform as a pattern. Real language written and spoken by human beings has a lot of anomalies: random changes in mood, emotion, word choice, syntax, etc. It's like comparing a handknit scarf to an industrial machine's knit scarf: one might have small mistakes that show it was made by a human hand, whereas the other is almost perfect because the machine follows an exact pattern."

How is it profitable for companies to offer services like navigation without subscription fees or ads?	GPS is free because it's a public service provided by the US government through a network of satellites. Your phone or device receives signals from these satellites to determine its location. Companies make profits by offering additional services or applications that use GPS data, such as navigational apps or ads based on your location. These companies don't need to pay for access to GPS data because the US government maintains and funds this infrastructure.	"GPS ""receivers"" are just radios that listen to broadcasts by specific satellites, and then use some math to calculate the location. There is no back and forth data transmission at all. So there is no capacity limit and no extra costs for more users. The US government created GPS as a military program. It would likely still be maintained even if no civilians used it, just like it was before it was opened up to the public."

Before chip and pin machines, credit/debit cards had a magnetic stripe that stored the cardholder's information. When making a purchase, the card was swiped through a machine that read the magnetic stripe, verifying the card's authenticity. To confirm the transaction, the cardholder would sign a receipt, which the merchant would compare to the signature on the back of the card. This system was less secure, as signatures can be forged and the magnetic stripe data could be more easily copied or skimmed.	Originally, the merchant had a small clipboard-like device with a roller. They'd place the card down, and a special piece of paper on top of it, then run the roller overtop which would imprint the card numbers onto the paper. They'd save all these records and then mail them to the bank. Then the information was contained in a magnetic strip like you see on the back of gift cards today which could be read by an electronic card reader when swiped.

For the purposes of this question, I’ll only consider apple’s face id system.	Apple's face id system distinguishes between a real face and a photograph through the use of 3d facial recognition technology. Instead of just analyzing a 2d image, face id projects over 30,000 infrared dots onto your face to create a 3d depth map. This depth map helps the system recognize the contours and features of a real face, making it much more difficult to deceive with a flat photograph. In addition, face id constantly learns and adapts to changes in your appearance, such as wearing glasses or growing a beard. Combining the 3d depth map with machine learning ensures that the system is not only secure but also incredibly accurate in distinguishing between a real face and a picture.	Face id doesn't just simply take a picture of your face, it uses an infrared projector to project dots on your face and then an infrared camera sees those dots calculates where those dots are in 3d space. For example if you were to hold up the face id sensor to two objects, one further away from the other it can determine with certainty which one of the 2 objects is closer and which one is further. If you were to just hold up a picture of a person, it will project the dots on top of the picture and see that it is entirely flat and therefore is not a face. [here's an example of what the projection of the dots look like. ](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4m6stzucow/maxresdefault. Jpg)

Movies appear smooth at 24 frames per second (fps) due to motion blur created by cameras capturing the natural blur of moving objects. Video games lack this natural motion blur as they consist of sharp, static images. To compensate, games need higher frame rates, like 60 fps, to create smoother transitions between static images, and reduce distractions caused by choppiness or sudden changes while playing. Additionally, games involve frequent interactions with controllers, requiring faster feedback to feel more responsive, which makes higher frame rates even more essential for a good gaming experience.	U/dragoniel is right about motion blur, but the more important answer is that movies very rarely move the camera, they certainly don't spin it 180 degrees in a fraction of a second. If they did everything in the shot would be a blurry mess. A whole load of thought goes into how you get the shot you want without too much camera motion and all the bullet time stuff from the matrix was done with many still cameras taking a single photo, not moving a camera on a rocket sled.
7	091b14fd-c6d2-4f59-a6a9-df511ec3cae7.txt	Why do consoles charge a online fee for games but PC doesn't?	Consoles charge an online fee primarily to cover the costs of maintaining and updating their online infrastructure, as well as to provide additional services like free games and discounts. In contrast, PC gaming relies on third-party platforms like steam, which take a share of the game sales instead of charging players directly for online access. Game developers and publishers handle their own servers for online gaming, spreading the cost through sales or in-game purchases.	It costs the console manufacturers some amount to maintain the infrastructure that console players use, but frankly, they make you pay for it because they can. You're locked into their ecosystem and have no option but to play by their rules. In the case of PC, there is no one company that controls your internet access through hardware like that. But there certainly are games that extract subscription fees to play them specifically, mostly MMOs.

Everyone seems up in arms about it and I can't figure out what an API even is. What would doing something like this actually affect?	"An API (application programming interface) is like a menu in a restaurant, where you can request specific actions or information from a website or software without having direct access to its inner workings. In the case of twitter, their API allows developers to create separate applications or tools that interact with twitter's platform. For example, a third-party app that helps manage your twitter account, schedule tweets, or analyze your tweets' performance, relies on twitter's API to function. To understand how an API works, imagine you're at a restaurant (twitter) and order a meal (request specific data) through a waiter (API). The chef (Twitter's system) prepares your food, and the waiter brings it back to you. You don't need to know how the chef cooked your meal; you only need to know what you want and communicate it through the waiter. By restricting free access to their api, twitter is limiting the number of free ""waiters"" or how often they can be used. This change could impact smaller developers or businesses who can't afford to pay for premium access, potentially leading to fewer third-party applications or tools for users."	APIs are used to communicate between systems (it's the middleman between systems), where the API just exposes an interface that other developers can use. Developers that call the API don't care how the API works, what it does or where/how it gets the data you want, all you care about is that you get what you wanted. &#x200b;imagine a restaurant; you come in, sit at a table and a waitress comes. You tell the waitress what you want to order, then the waitress brings you your meal. Now, you don't care how the meal was made, who cooked it, or from which ingredients, likewise you also don't care what the waitress had to do in order to get and bring you your meal. All you care is that they brought you your meal and you didn't have to do anything else other than tell the waitress what you wanted. The waitress is the API in this case (the middleman between you and the kitchen), the kitchen is the server's backend and the customer is the developer.

USB 3. 0/3. 1/3. 2 gen 1 AKA the kind that can do 5 gbps can only use cables up to 3m in length. Meanwhile ethernet uses a similar twisted pair copper cable, but can do 10 gbps over 100m.	USB 3.0 and ethernet cables are designed for different purposes and have different signaling methods. USB cables prioritize speed for short distances, while ethernet cables prioritize reliable data transfer over long distances. In usb 3. 0, the data transfer speed drops dramatically after 3 meters because it uses high-frequency signals that lose strength over longer distances. To maintain the high speed, it is necessary to keep cables short or use repeaters to amplify the signal, which adds cost and complexity. Ethernet cables are designed for longer distances, using twisted pairs of wires to reduce interference while maintaining a steady (though slower) data transfer speed. They achieve speeds of up to 10 gbps over 100 meters, allowing for broader connections in networked environments like offices and homes. In summary, the difference in cable length is due to usb 3. 0 optimizing for high-speed short-distance connections, while ethernet focuses on steady data transfer over longer distances.	Think of USB as 2 people communicating without seeing each other. If person a stops talking for a period of time, person b will thing/assume person a has left or no longer wishes to talk. Moving the two people further way from each other increases the time something takes to travel between the two people, and communication starts to break down. In reality, USB has a maximum tolerance for response times from devices in the standard, if that response time is longer then 1.5μs, then the standard assumes something went wrong, leading to the 5m length being the maximum. Ethernet doesn't wait or care about responses, thus can be as long as you need, though the signal will break down over long distances, which is why repeaters exist.

GPUs, or graphics processing units, are specialized hardware designed to handle complex graphics-related tasks efficiently, while CPUs, or central processing units, are responsible for general computing tasks. Think of the CPU as a multitasking manager, while the GPU is the expert artist. When rendering images or playing video games, the CPU sends data like textures, lighting, and geometry to the gpu. The GPU then processes that information quickly and efficiently, generating images for display. Without a GPU, the CPU would have to handle both general tasks and graphics processing, leading to slower performance and less efficient image rendering.	The CPU is a mathematician that sits in the attic working on a new theory. The GPU is hundreds of thousands of 2nd graders working on 1+1 math all at the same time. These days, the CPU is now more like 8 mathematicians sitting in the attic but you get the point. They're both suited for different jobs. The CPU _could_ update the picture that you see on the display, but that's grunt work. Edit: I don't mean the cores in a GPU are stupid, but their instruction set isn't as complex & versatile as a CPU's which is what I meant.

To start off, the Chinese government has a habit and history of having back doors into a lot of products made by companies that have their home there. For example, huawei, a company known for phones and servers was ~~discovered a a few years back to have been putting gov. Back doors into server chips used by American companies. ~~ under heavy suspicion by American companies and others for having backdoor in their systems after various security flaws were found. On top of that, most analysis of the app itself have set off quite a few red flags, such as requiring way more security permissions than it should need, their terms of service requiring you to allow them to ""build a full profile,"" on you including who you interact with and every bit of info about you, and iirc was found to be uploading keystrokes or copied clipboard data at frequent intervals, which is a great way to get someone's passwords and/or other sensitive data. So we're at the point of ""it's doing a lot of weird shit that it shouldn't be, but we can't *prove* it's doing anything malicious with it... yet. ""edit: because I'm seeing it here **a lot** I'm going to clear this up. No, this is not the same thing as Google, Instagram, Facebook, etc. in the US. Here in the US (and most western countries) we not only have privacy laws that protect US from certain breaches, but more importantly the government and company are two separate entities, and are even frequently at each-other's throats. While all those companies certainly collect data, they are *not* responsible for handing it directly to their government outside of official process such as warrants and subpoenas. In China it's the opposite, companies over a certain size are required to by law to allow the government to access and have direct control over large sections of the companies operations. The problem worsens when we remember that China isn't really the best of friends with a lot of western nations, and giving *them specifically* control over what large numbers of western people (especially youth) see and interact with is not great for national security. Should you still always keep privacy in mind with the western companies? Absolutely, but the two issues are worlds apart. Edit 2: cool that so many of you have opinions and thoughts on this. Got a little distracted by all of them and the pasta I was cooking now has the consistency of oatmeal 😅. Great having all the discussion, but getting lots of notifications still, so I'm going to mute notifications on this thread. Ttyl"	The main concern surrounding Tiktok app being a potential Chinese spyware stems from its ties to China and the country's strict data control laws, as well as some security vulnerabilities that have been identified in the past. However, it is important to note that direct evidence of Tiktok being used as spyware by the Chinese government has not been discovered or publicly disclosed. First, let's understand what Tiktok is and its connection to China. Tiktok is a popular short-form video-sharing app owned by a Chinese company called bytedance. The app has gained immense popularity globally, particularly among young people, who use it to create and share lip-sync, dance, and comedy videos. Now, let's discuss the factors that contribute to the concerns regarding Tiktok as Chinese spyware:1. Chinese data control laws: China has strict data control laws, which require companies operating in the country to comply with government requests for access to data. This means that if the Chinese government demands that bytedance provide user data, the company could be legally obligated to comply. This raises concerns about the privacy and security of the data of millions of users outside China, particularly in countries like the United states, where there have been rising tensions with the Chinese government. 2. Security vulnerabilities: in the past, security researchers have identified security vulnerabilities within the Tiktok app. For example, a vulnerability reported in early 2020 allowed hackers to hijack user accounts by sending malicious links through SMS messages. Although Tiktok has since claimed to have patched these vulnerabilities, concerns remain about the app's overall security and potential exploitation to gather data on its users. 3. Data collection and storage: like many internet-based platforms, Tiktok collects a significant amount of data on its users, including location data, browsing and search history, and device information. This data is stored primarily in data centers in the United states, but a portion of it is also backed up in Singapore. Critics argue that this data could potentially be accessed or transferred to the Chinese government, despite claims by Tiktok that its data is stored securely and separately from its parent company, bytedance. 4. Algorithm transparency: the algorithm that powers Tiktok's content recommendation system is proprietary and has not been made transparent to users or regulators. This has raised concerns about potential manipulation, censorship, or surveillance through content and algorithmic control. In summary, while there has not been direct evidence showing that Tiktok is being actively used as spyware by the Chinese government, the concerns surrounding its potential to act as such arise from its connections to China, the country's data control laws, security vulnerabilities, data collection practices, and lack of algorithm transparency. Consequently, some countries have banned or considered banning Tiktok due to these concerns, and the debate about the app's security and privacy implications continues.

When you access a website, you can indeed see and save the HTML, CSS, and javascript code that make up the structure, design, and basic functionality of the site. However, many modern websites rely on server-side programming and databases to handle complex tasks, store data, and offer interactive features. The server-side code and the data are not sent to your browser, so you can't just copy it. Think of a website like an iceberg: what you can see and access is just the tip above the water (html, css, javascript), while the hidden, larger part underwater represents the server-side code and databases. So, while you can copy the visible portion of a site, recreating the entire site with full functionality would require access to the hidden parts, which is typically not provided.	"Only some code is presented to the client on the front end. A lot of the heavy lifting is done on the backend using code that the browser is unaware of. In addition, most interactions you have with websites involve databases of information. Without having your own similar mirror of data, the code is largely functionless. Many years ago, web development classes would often have people build a ""pizza ordering website"", using html and eventually css - form fields, etc. - but those are just a facade... They rarely actually did anything tangible or saved data anywhere until you got further. Copying the source code of most websites is going to give you fairly poor results, go ahead and try it, it is basically just stealing the non-working pizza ordering UI, at best case scenario."

They can’t. At least not usually. There may be some crappy websites that allow them to try thousands of times by directly submitting to the website. But if it’s a site that has rate limits or max numbers of errors (like in your example), they aren’t trying to get in that way. So how do they get in? One way is that they somehow have already stolen your plain text password (it was leaked on the internet, they socially engineered and got you to give it to them, they stole it from the site which had terrible security and stored it in plain text. ) or, they have stolen a *hash* of your password directly from the site, and they can then try to reverse engineer your password from the hash, either by use of rainbow tables (common passwords and their hashes pre-calculated) or by dictionary/brute force attacks. But at that point, the hash is stored in their own computer, so they aren’t limited by the site’s security measures.	When you type a wrong password more than three times, you get locked out of an app as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. On the other hand, hackers use different methods to bypass such restrictions and try thousands of passwords until they find the correct one. One common method hackers use is called 'brute force attack' where they use powerful computers and specialized software to try countless password combinations in a short period. To avoid the lockout mechanism, hackers might use a list of leaked or stolen passwords from other websites, hoping that people reuse the same password across different platforms. This strategy is called 'credential stuffing.' Another technique is called 'dictionary attack' in which hackers use a list of common or previously used passwords, rather than trying every possible combination. They can try these passwords for multiple accounts and often find success, especially if users have weak or easy-to-guess passwords. Lastly, hackers may also exploit vulnerabilities in the app or website itself to bypass the lockout mechanisms altogether. This might involve exploiting a bug or using techniques like SQL injection to access the user's account without even needing the correct password.
14	caa895fc-a2f8-4ebd-ad43-c632bd36d31d.txt	How come a CPU can function without any driver updates whereas a GPU needs one every month or so for stability?	A CPU is like the brain of a computer and handles general tasks, while a GPU specializes in graphics and video-related tasks. Cpu designs are relatively stable, requiring fewer updates. Gpus, however, need frequent updates because new games and applications often push graphics capabilities to their limits. These driver updates help optimize the GPU for the latest software, improving performance, fixing bugs, and maintaining stability.	The eli5 answer is that you do run updates for your CPU, just don’t notice that because they are packaged into stuff like ios updates or windows updates. Operating systems have a thing called “kernel” that can be seen as the driver of your CPU (yes yes I know is not a perfect analogy but this is eli5) and that is updated regularly by windows/mac/linux operating systems.

"Torrents are a way to share files efficiently by breaking them into smaller pieces and distributing them among multiple users. Instead of downloading a file directly from one source (like in traditional file sharing), you download bits of the file from several sources simultaneously. This method speeds up the download process and reduces the burden on a single server. To break down the concept of torrents, we can think of it like assembling a puzzle. Imagine a large jigsaw puzzle that you want to complete. Instead of getting all the puzzle pieces from one person, you receive a few pieces from each of your friends. As you start to put the puzzle together, you share the pieces you have with others who also want to complete the puzzle. Everyone works together, sharing their pieces until the puzzle is completed. In the world of torrents, the puzzle represents the file you want to download, and the pieces are smaller parts of that file. When you download a torrent, you use a torrent client (like utorrent or bittorrent) to connect to a network of people who have the pieces of the file you need. These people are collectively known as the ""swarm. ""now, let's talk about ""seeding"" and ""leeching. "" seeding refers to the act of sharing your completed puzzle pieces (file pieces) with others in the swarm. When you finish downloading a file, you become a ""seeder. "" you continue to share the file pieces, helping others complete their puzzle. The more seeders there are, the faster and smoother the download process is for everyone. Leeching refers to downloading the pieces of the puzzle (file pieces) without contributing or sharing back to the swarm. When someone downloads a file but doesn't share what they've downloaded with others, they're considered a ""leecher. "" leeching can slow down the download process and is generally seen as poor etiquette in the torrent community. So, while torrents do involve sharing files directly from your pc, it's different from traditional file sharing in that the file is split into pieces and distributed among multiple users, speeding up the download process and reducing strain on individual sources. The process of seeding and leeching helps keep the torrent system efficient and functional."	It is basically like directly sharing, but not quite. A file (it can be anything) is separated into many smaller pieces, each getting a special name. The torrent basically holds this information and the instructions on how to assemble the smaller pieces into one piece, the original file. This instruction (a torrent) is coupled with additional information which keeps track of various computers across the internet which have the same torrent and which pieces of the original file they have. This additional information is called trackers. When you download a specific torrent and run it using software made to read it, the software knows what smaller pieces of the larger file you lack (when you begin you lack all of them) and it checks which computers have those smaller pieces. Then it downloads the smaller pieces from any available computer which has them. Once it has all the pieces, they are assembled into the original file. Seeders is the name for the computers which the entire file and thus all the smaller pieces. Leechers is the name for the computers which do not have the entire file, but rather any amount of the smaller pieces. The benefit of the system is that you can download any piece from any computer which has it, be they seeders or leechers, as long as those computers are currently running the torrent software and are connected to the internet. So, in short, torrents help by distributing a file to as many people as possible and allow anyone to download that file by taking pieces from everyone until they have the whole thing. This way nobody is dependant on one place that holds the file. If someone disconnects or deletes the file it is still available to download from the other people who have it. Of course, if everyone who has the complete file were to delete it, nobody would be able to get the full file anymore.

Developing nuclear weapons is a highly complex and resource-intensive task that requires advanced scientific knowledge, technical skills, substantial funding, and access to specific materials, which makes it difficult for some countries to achieve. Firstly, nuclear weapons are based on intricate scientific principles. To create a nuclear bomb, a nation must have a deep understanding of nuclear fission or fusion, which involve splitting or combining atomic nuclei, respectively. This requires highly skilled scientists and engineers who can design and build the necessary equipment. Secondly, obtaining the materials needed for a nuclear weapon can be challenging. Enriched uranium or plutonium is required, and these elements are not commonly found in nature. The process to produce them, such as uranium enrichment or reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, is technologically demanding and expensive. Thirdly, the development process must be carefully hidden from foreign intelligence agencies, as international treaties and organizations like the united nations actively work to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. This means that countries must maintain secrecy while conducting research, procuring materials, and conducting tests. Lastly, the financial costs associated with creating nuclear weapons are enormous. Building the infrastructure, such as research facilities and reactors, along with obtaining materials and retaining skilled personnel, requires significant investment. Many countries struggle to allocate the needed resources when they are faced with numerous competing priorities, like economic development or social welfare programs. In summary, the challenges of scientific knowledge, material availability, secrecy, and financial costs contribute to the difficulty of developing nuclear weapons for some countries.	The main problem is the nuclear fuel that powers the bomb. Uranium is a fairly rare element on its own, but to make a bomb you need lots of a very rare isotope of uranium (u-235) that’s chemically identical but weighs ever so slightly less. To separate out this rare isotope you need to turn it into a gas and spin it in a centrifuge. But this is so slow you need a gigantic factory with *thousands* of centrifuges, that consume as much electrical power as a small city. Another fuel, plutonium, is refined differently, but it also takes a massive industrial operation to make. Either way, this is all too expensive for a small group to do, only medium and large countries can afford it. But the even bigger problem is that all this factory infrastructure is impossible to hide. If you’re making nuclear bombs, you probably have enemies who want to stop you, and a giant factory full of delicate equipment is an easy target. So to make a bomb, you need to be rich enough to build both a gigantic power-sucking factory *and* a military powerful enough to protect it from people who would like to stop you.

Additionally, why can’t spam calls be automatically blocked, and why is nobody really doing a whole lot about it? It seems like this is a problem that they would have come up with a solution for by now.	Spam call centers can't be automatically shut down because they are often located in countries with weak regulation and they use advanced techniques to hide their identity, like caller id spoofing. Blocking spam calls is challenging because these callers use ever-changing phone numbers, making it difficult to maintain an updated block list. While there are some efforts to combat spam calls, such as telecom companies implementing call-filtering systems and governments enacting regulations, the issue is deeply rooted in the economic incentive for spam callers and the complexities in tracking them down. Ultimately, tackling spam calls requires international cooperation and continuous technology advancements.	Most of the spam call centers originate in countries where the governments don't _really_ care all that much. For example, a good number of them are in smaller cities in India, where the politicians are willing to turn a blind eye for the right price (and so long as they don't go around scamming indians). From there, the call centers are just another overseas call. There are a number of _legitimate_ call centers in foreign countries, so looking to block the scam ones is a needle in a stack of needles. Its a ton of effort for the phone company with little actual benefit to them.

""".io"" is a domain extension, like "".com"" or "".org,"" originally assigned to the Indian ocean territory. It became popular among tech startups and online games because ""io"" can represent ""input/output"" in computer terms. In online gaming, it symbolized a new genre of simple, multiplayer browser games such as agar. Io or slither. Io, where players could join together in real-time without needing to download anything. Now, many games and websites use "". Io"" to suggest a modern, innovative image, even if they aren't related to the Indian ocean territory, or aren't browser-based games."	"Some domains are related to countries. ""domain.uk"" is United kingdom, and ""domain.cn"" is China, and ""domain.tm"" is Turkmenistan. ""io"" stands for ""Indian ocean"", as in the ""British Indian ocean territory"". Approximately 1000 islands south of India. Mostly inhabited by military people, and the natives were removed in the 60s and 70s. Not a nice place! The rights to the ""io"" domain were bought by rich tech guys to make money in the 90s and they've made a lot of money from it. The name sounds kinda geeky because in tech we say io to mean input/output."

"Noise cancellation works by using microphones to detect external sounds and then generating an opposite sound wave to cancel it out. This is called ""destructive interference."" In small earbuds, tiny microphones pick up surrounding noise and internal speakers produce the counteracting sound waves. Advanced processing algorithms help make this process quick and efficient. As a result, you mainly hear the music or sound you're playing, with significantly reduced background noise."	You know how your headphones can reproduce any sound? Noise cancelling headphones have microphones to detect what outside sounds you're about to hear and then make the exact opposite sound at exactly the right time. Any sound (no matter how complex or loud) + its exact opposite = no sound at all, much like 5 + (-5) = 0. I could get into superposition and all that, but that's probably beyond age 5.

Electric vehicles use one large battery for efficiency and design simplicity. Combining many smaller batteries would increase the overall weight, complexity, and costs of the system. Also, managing multiple smaller batteries requires sophisticated power management systems to balance charge and discharge rates. By using one large battery, automakers can optimize the vehicle's performance, weight distribution, and energy storage. Additionally, a single battery system is easier to replace or recycle when it reaches the end of its lifespan.	More often than not, they do have a lot of smaller batteries that can be swapped out based on need. It's just that, eh, the batteries are a safety hazard for rescue services when the cars are in accidents, and to make them less of a hazard they are combined into a large container that is comparably good at confining the hazard. There are other reasons to, such as thermal control of the batteries and weight distribution concerns.

I just feel like they renamed 4G into 5g, 3G into 4G and edge into 3g. Jokes aside, I know the overall amount of data to load today per website/video/images is way heavier than before, but still. A simple Google search doesn’t require much more to load than 12 years ago.	3G may feel slower today due to a combination of factors, like increased data usage, congestion, and evolving technology standards. As more people use mobile internet, networks become congested, which can reduce 3G performance. Additionally, websites and apps have become more data-heavy, requiring more bandwidth to load quickly. Even though a simple Google search may not have changed much, the surrounding internet ecosystem has evolved, making 3G seem slower in comparison. Moreover, as companies invest more in 4G and 5g, they might allocate fewer resources to maintaining or improving 3G networks, which can affect its speed.	When 3G was the new hotness, all the telephone providers put up hundreds and hundreds of antennas to support the new, fast technology. As 4g, and later 5G came out, the older antennas were taken down, and replaced with the upgraded antennas. Back in the day, your cell phone could talk to 5 different 3G antennaes, and there was plenty of antennas to support the entire population of 3G phones. Now, there might only be one antenna for 20 mi circle, so everyone who's still on 3G phones has to use that one antenna, making it very slow.

PC GPUs require frequent updates due to the diverse and constantly evolving hardware and software ecosystem, while consoles have standardized hardware configurations that don't change during their life cycle. In the world of PCs, there are countless combinations of graphics cards, processors, operating systems, and other components. Game developers create their games with certain graphics capabilities in mind, but they must accommodate a wide range of hardware setups. To ensure their games run smoothly on various systems, developers often work closely with GPU manufacturers like Nvidia or AMD. These manufacturers release driver updates to optimize their GPUs for new and upcoming games, improving performance and fixing possible issues. On the other hand, consoles like the Playstation or Xbox have a fixed set of hardware components that remain the same for several years. When game developers create a title for a specific console, they know exactly which hardware their game will run on. This means they can optimize their games to take full advantage of the console's capabilities without needing updates for graphics hardware. In summary, the difference in GPU update frequency between pcs and consoles is due to a difference in their hardware landscapes: PCs have diverse, ever-changing hardware configurations, while consoles maintain a consistent, standardized setup throughout their life cycles.	"Consoles hardware is fixed. If I am a developer, making a game for the Xbox, I can be confident that every Xbox that runs that game will operate the exact same way. As long as I code my game and test it to xbox specs, I never need to worry about it not working on an xbox in the wild. Pc's aren't like that. 2 pc's, even with the same graphics card, can have different motherboards, different ram, different operating systems, different drivers, different peripherals, different northbridge chips, different south bridge chips, different storage controllers, different network interfaces, the list is endless. So while you can code you game for the ""standard reference architecture"" of the GPU and os you are coding for, it is impossible to account for every single hardware permutation that your game could encounter out in the wild. So you do your best to make it work on the ""standard"" configuration, and if post release you find an issue that effects a large enough of your userbase to care about, you have to patch it."

Visiting my parents, my mom seems disappointed to find me washing my clothes in cold water, she says it's just not right but couldn't quite explain why.	Water temperature matters in washing clothes because it affects the cleaning efficiency and care for the fabric. Hot water is more effective at removing stains and killing bacteria, making it suitable for heavily soiled items or bed linens. Warm water is a middle ground, providing decent cleaning without being too harsh on fabrics. Cold water is eco-friendly and gentle on clothes, preventing shrinking and color bleeding but is less effective in removing tough stains. Choosing the right temperature depends on the type of fabric, level of soiling, and colorfastness of the garments.	"Once upon a time, detergents didn't work so well in cold water. Washing machines had cycles like ""cotton 140f"" and ""delicates 100f"" and that was how your mom grew up. If you washed in cold water it didn't work well at getting your clothes clean, and it didn't rinse well either. Since she grew up there have been huge improvements in detergent efficacy and you can wash really well in cold water, which is much cheaper for your energy bill and better for the environment too. Far from doing something wrong, you're doing it right!"

Emulators are needed to play old games because they replicate the original hardware's environment, allowing the game to run as intended. Modern systems have different hardware and software architectures that can't directly run old games. Emulators act as translators that bridge this gap, converting the game's instructions to be compatible with the new system. Without emulators, extensive modifications would be required for each game, which would be time-consuming and potentially compromise the original experience.	The issue is that the games code wants to use some functions that the old operating system provided, but a new one doesn't. You could make it work by changing the code of the game completely, but especially for older games that's not necessarily easy (and often illegal) and simply booting up a virtual old os running inside the new OS (the emulator) is just easier.

They are vastly superior to training on CPUs. Why is this?	GPU architecture is better for training neural networks because it's designed for handling many small calculations simultaneously, while CPUs are optimized for more complex, sequential tasks. Neural networks require thousands of simple mathematical operations that can be processed in parallel, which is a GPU's strength. Think of GPUs as many workers doing simple tasks together, while CPUs are a few workers doing complex tasks individually. Since ML/AI involves a lot of parallel computations, GPUs can drastically reduce the time needed for training and make them the preferred choice over CPUs in these cases.	"Imagine you have 1 million math assignments to do, they are very simple assignments, but there are a lot that need to be done, they are not dependent on each other so they can be done on any order. You have two options, distribute them to 10 thousand people to do it in parallel or give them to 10 math experts. The experts are very fast, but hey, there are only 10 of them, the 10 thousand are more suitable for the task because they have the ""brute force"" for this. GPUs have thousands of cores, CPUs have tens."

The main difference between various programming languages is the way they are designed, their syntax, and their intended use. While they all allow us to give instructions to computers, they each have unique features and benefits. Think of programming languages like tools in a toolbox: a hammer, a screwdriver, and a wrench all serve different purposes but can work together to build or fix something. Some programming languages, like python, are designed to be easy to read and write, making them great for beginners or for tasks like data analysis. Others, like c++, are more complex and powerful, making them well-suited for building high-performance applications like video games. Java, on the other hand, prioritizes cross-platform compatibility, allowing developers to write code that can run on different devices without modification. In essence, although programming languages can accomplish similar tasks, each one has its own strengths and purposes, and developers choose the best language for their specific project.	Eventually, yes. Any programming language can achieve the same thing as another programming language (as long as they're turing-complete, but that's beyond eli5). The difference isn't about their capabilities, the difference is about their features. For example, take python - it's not a compiled language, but an interpreted one. In practical terms it means it's slower, so what are the advantages? Well, it's easier to read and easier to write for humans. Take c/c++ - it's compiled, it's way faster than python, but you need to have some serious knowledge to write very efficiently in it. Or take matlab - it's not even really designed for programmers, it's meant for mathematicians/physicists. Each programming language has some features that it excels at but at the cost of other features. It's impossible to write a language that's super-fast, super-easy to learn, super-fun to write in and has all the super-features programmers love, so programming languages compromise.

While building a giant solar farm in Australia is technically possible, the main challenge is the cost and efficient transfer of energy over long distances. Australia's vast size and remote areas require extensive infrastructure for energy transmission, making it expensive. Additionally, energy losses occur when transmitted over long distances. These factors, combined with political and economic considerations, make it difficult for a large-scale solar farm to become a reality in Australia at the moment.	If I recall correctly there are solar farms and there are plans to build many many more in the north. It takes time to build these things and solar used to be awful at producing energy. They plan to be a big exporter of hydrogen, so I think a lot of the solar will go towards that. Edit: if anyone happens to have western Australia's map of the planned solar farms, I'd love to track it down.

When you are asked to input your card information online, how is it that some websites can automatically know if you input an invalid number and others cannot, before payment is processed? Example: as soon as I typed the last number of my card wrong, it went red and would not allow me to continue before I corrected it.	"A valid card number is determined by an algorithm called the luhn algorithm, which is a simple mathematical formula used to verify the unique sequence of numbers on a credit or debit card. Some websites have the ability to recognize an invalid number immediately by implementing a luhn algorithm check before payment is processed, while others might not have this feature or choose not to use it. The luhn algorithm, also known as the ""modulus 10"" or ""mod 10"" algorithm, was created by German computer scientist hans Peter Luhn in the 1960s. It checks the validity of a card number by performing a series of mathematical steps that ultimately result in a single-digit number. However, it’s important to note that the luhn algorithm can only verify if a number is mathematically valid—not whether it’s attached to an active or legitimate bank account. Here's a simplified version of how the luhn algorithm works:1. Starting from the rightmost digit, double the value of every second digit. For example, if your credit card number is 1234 5678 9012 3456, you would double the numbers in bold: 1_34_67_90_23_56. 2. If doubling any of the numbers results in a two-digit number (e.g. , if 7 is doubled, it becomes 14), then add the two digits together (1+4=5). This results in a new sequence of numbers. 3. Add all the resulting digits together, including the ones that were not doubled. 4. If the sum of all the digits is divisible by 10 (i.e., has a remainder of 0 when divided by 10), then the card number is considered valid. In our example:1. After doubling every second digit: 1_6_3_14_6_18_9_12_2_6_5_122. After adding any two-digit numbers together: 1_6_3_5_6_9_9_12_2_6_5_33. The sum of all resulting digits: 1+6+3+5+6+9+9+3+2+6+5+3 = 584. Since 58 is not divisible by 10, this example number would be considered invalid. Some websites implement a luhn algorithm check as a pre-validation step when a user inputs their card number. This helps to ensure that the user doesn't accidentally enter an invalid number, such as by mistyping a digit. The check can save both the user and the website time and potential frustration by catching the error before the payment attempt is made. In conclusion, the luhn algorithm is the primary method for determining if a card number is valid. Not all websites implement this algorithm in their payment processes, but those that do can identify invalid card numbers"	Tmi about credit card numbers. There’s actually a ton of information contained in a credit card number. This information isn’t really necessary for understanding how to use a credit card, it’s just here so you can learn for fun. The iso or the international organization for standardization categorizes the numbers like so:digits 1 – 6: issuer identifier numbers, first digit: represents the network that produced the credit card. It is called the major industry identifier (MII). Each digit represents a different industry. 0: iso/tc 68 and other industry assignments 1: airlines 2: airlines, financial and other future industry assignments 3: travel and entertainment 4: banking and financial 5: banking and financial 6: merchandising and banking/financial 7: petroleum and other future industry assignments 8: healthcare, telecommunications and other future industry assignments 9: for assignment by national standards bodies. The first digit is different for each card network:visa cards begin with a 4 and have 13 or 16 digits, mastercard cards begin with a 5 and has 16 digits, American express cards begin with a 3, followed by a 4 or a 7 has 15 digits, discover cards begin with a 6 and have 16 digits, diners club and carte blanche cards begin with a 3, followed by a 0, 6, or 8 and have 14 digits. Digits 2 – 6: provide an identifier for a particular institution. Digits 7 – 15: unique personal identifiers identify the cardholder name unique to the issuer. Digit 16: check digit this last digit verifies card numbers for accuracy to make sure that they weren’t input incorrectly. The rest of the digits are also different for each card network:visa cards:digits 2 – 6: make up the bank number, digits 7 – 12 or 7 – 15: represent the account number, digits 13 or 16: is a check digit, mastercard cards:digits 2 & 3, 2 – 4, 2 – 5, or 2 – 6: make up the bank number; depends on whether digit two is a 1, 2, 3 or other digit. Digits after the bank number, up to digit 15: represent the account number, digit 16: is a check digit, american express cards:digits 3 & 4: are type and currency, digits 5 – 11: represent the account number, digits 12 – 14: represent the card number within the account, digit 15: is a check digit.

A subnet mask is a tool that separates an ip address into two parts: the network address and the host address. It's used to organize and manage a network efficiently. Imagine a huge apartment building, where the subnet mask acts as a floor plan that helps you find which floor (network) an apartment (device) is located on. By using different subnet masks, administrators can divide a larger network into smaller subnetworks. This improves organization, maximizes efficiency, and increases security by limiting the spread of potential issues. In simpler terms, a subnet mask is like a filter that helps sort through vast networks to find individual devices.	Here's a real eli5 instead of the eli30 the rest of the responses post:think of network packets like letters in the mail. Your address says which house you live at on the first line, and the zipcode tells the post office what general area you live in and what post office should service you. Subnet masks are the zip codes and tell a network device if you're in the same neighborhood or not. If you are in the same zipcode, mail doesn't need additional help to get to you. If you're in another zip code, your mail will go to the nearest post office to be routed appropriately.

Investors' confidence was shaken by events such as the pandemic, overwhelming hype, and scams, causing them to sell their crypto assets. Additionally, governments worldwide started implementing stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies, making it harder for people to invest and trade. As a result, the demand for cryptocurrencies decreased, leading to a decline in their overall value.	People are mostly interested in crypto to make money. They pile in while it is going up in price and run away when the price stops going up. You can look at the price history of bitcoin and see every 4 years we’ve gone through a clear bubble. The last year has been a combination of the crypto bubble popping again, the interest rates rising and some shady crypto exchanges going down.

I've heard many times that the reason the silent hill remaster collection didn't turn out so well was because Konami lost the original source code and had to re-create it. But I don't understand how that is possible. If they were selling copies of silent hill, why couldn't they just take a single disk of it and datamine the source code off of it? How could they possess the game without possessing the game's source code?	The main reason Konami lost the source code for the original silent hill game is that they didn't have proper archiving and backup procedures in place, which was more common in the early days of video game development. While it may seem strange, this kind of incident has happened to other game developers as well. Now, to understand why they couldn't just datamine the source code from the retail copies of the game, we need to know the difference between source code and compiled code. Source code is the human-readable version of a program, written by developers in a specific programming language. It usually contains comments, variable names, and is structured in a way that makes it easier for developers to work with. When the game is ready to be distributed, the source code is compiled, which means it is translated into a low-level, machine-readable language called binary code. This binary code is what runs on the game consoles or computers, and it is much harder to reverse-engineer back into source code. Retail copies of the game contain the compiled binary code, so even if they were to datamine them, they wouldn't get the original source code. Instead, they'd get a series of ones and zeroes, which would be nearly impossible to reconstruct into the original source code. As for the silent hill remaster collection, because they didn't have access to the original source code, developers had to rely on reverse-engineering the game as best as they could or rebuild certain parts from scratch. This led to a less-than-perfect remaster, as some features or visual elements could have been lost or altered during this process. This is why having proper backups and archiving of original source code is essential for game preservation and future remastering efforts.	Source code is different than the compiled code. Think of it like a recipe for a cake, and a baked cake. Having a cake, or even eating it and being able to tell “flour, eggs, butter, vanilla, sugar” doesn’t necessarily tell you how to make the cake. You can get some info from this, but generally not an entire full recipe and steps from it. Source code is the exact text of the programing language that is human readable, “if hp = 0, then player = dead” (not a real language, but an easy example). It is then fed through a compiler that translates it to “machine speak”. Like mixing it then baking it in an oven so it can be eaten. Compiled/object code is what the computer makes sense of. You can reverse engineer some things from compiled if you’re really dedicated and skilled, but even then it’s not an exact match and things can get messed up. You lose variables, notes, etc which would then need to be un-borked. In the previous example, it would end up like “if [unknown variable] = 0 then…” but games have a lot of variables. Player locations, loot values, damage, hp, ranges, light values, player speed, etc. So now unless that’s fixed the game is broken. Which *can* be fixed, but it’s often easier to recreate the game. As a side note, it’s why source code leaks are a big deal for programs. For games as an example, it would describe how the game works, including things like anti-cheat.

I have only seen commercials so it probably does not work as great. Just curious as to how the phone “guesses” what the background looks like and fills it in.	"The Google phone's ""magical erasing"" feature works by using AI and machine learning to analyze and identify people, objects, and the background in a photo. By taking a series of images quickly, it can detect the differences between them, like people moving or objects shifting. The phone's software can then use the information gathered from multiple photos to reconstruct the background, remove the undesired objects or people, and stitch the remaining parts together in a seamless manner. This gives you a clean, clear image with the unwanted elements removed."	"It uses machine learning to predict what the background ""ought"" to look like. Basically they have an algorithm they showed a million before/after photos, and based on that, the algorithm now understands how to create an ""after"" from a ""before"". It's all just math, nothing particularly insightful about it. You can easily notice insufficiencies in it. For example it will never create something new, which an unobstructed photo might have (for example, it would never create, like, a black cat in the frame). The new background will always be something relatively basic."

When you wear a good pair of headphones or earphones, the sound feels like it's coming from inside your head because the audio source is positioned very close to your ears, and the audio signals are delivered directly into the ear canal. Unlike speakers that produce sound from a distance, headphones create an intimate listening experience. An important factor contributing to this sensation is the elimination of external noise. High-quality headphones can block out ambient sounds, allowing you to focus solely on the audio being played. Moreover, they can also prevent sound from leaking out, creating a more immersive experience. Another aspect is the accurate reproduction of audio cues, such as stereo or binaural effects, which trigger specific spatial perceptions in our brains. Headphones can provide detailed sound reproduction that helps create a sense of depth and direction, further enhancing the feeling of the audio originating inside your head.	When you hear a car driving up from your left, the sound gets to your left ear a little before your right ear. Your brain figures out where a sound is coming from by comparing when the sounds reached each ear. Your brain does a lot of other stuff too, like use the way sound bounces off your ear, how loud it is, and how crisp the sound is to figure out where it came from. When you put on a nice pair of headphones that are playing the same thing at the exact same time, your brain does the math. No difference in when the sound gets there? Must be directly in front of or behind me. Very crisp, no echoes from walls? Must be really close. No reverb off of my ear? Must be inside the head.

"Arch linux is an open-source operating system that stands out from other linux distributions due to its simplicity, flexibility, and minimalistic design. Unlike more beginner-friendly linux options (such as ubuntu), it focuses on giving advanced users the tools and freedom to control their own system. The main difference between arch and other distributions is its rolling release model. While other distributions often have periodic updates that require a full system upgrade, arch continually updates its software packages. This ensures users always have access to the latest software versions. Another unique aspect is its package manager, ""pacman."" It enables users to install and manage software easily, with a vast range of packages available through the arch user repository (AUR). AUR is a community-driven repository, which means its content is provided and maintained by users themselves. The elitism and disgust around arch linux often come from the ""diy"" attitude and the learning curve associated with it. While arch enthusiasts love the degree of control they have over their systems, critics view this as unnecessary complexity. Some arch users may come off as arrogant or dismissive of people using ""simpler"" distributions, giving arch a reputation for attracting a certain type of tech-savvy user. In summary, arch linux is a flexible, minimalistic linux distribution with a rolling release model, which attracts advanced users but can feel overwhelming for beginners or those who prefer a more guided experience."	As part of a society that uses computers for nearly every facet of daily life, we typically know astonishingly little about how they operate. Arch linux breaks up all the fixtures of computer operation into manageable chunks to be put together (assuming it's user knows how they work) so that if anything ever goes wrong, there is a small presumption it can be repaired (for excellent ego points). However, this is like building your own home in a way. You may be able to go on the sears catalog (or menards catalog for this century) and get all the parts of a house delivered, but putting it together and having a house you're proud of that seems stable and pretty to other people isn't always possible if you don't care to learn how houses work. Many people would just like a house to be built by professionals because they would rather everything work without them knowing how than try to fix a magnitude more problems that they do know (usually) how to fix. Gentoo is the next level deeper. If arch linux is an apprentice carpenter, then gentoo is the journeyman. Masters would be the distro developer.

"Recharging batteries before they hit 0% improves their durability mainly because of the way most modern batteries, specifically lithium-ion batteries, function and respond to stress. Using a battery's full charge capacity, from 100% to 0%, strains the battery and gradually reduces its overall life. This is called a ""cycle,"" and a battery has a limited number of these cycles. For example, if a battery lasts for 5 years with 1,000 complete cycles, it would last around 2. 5 years with 2,000 cycles. By partially discharging and recharging a battery, we extend its life by reducing the number of complete cycles. Also, lithium-ion batteries prefer staying within a certain range of charge, typically between 20% and 80%. Extreme charges, like 100% or 0%, can cause additional stress and decrease battery life. Regularly keeping the battery within this ""safe zone"" can extend its life and performance. Think of a battery like a rubber band: if you stretch it to its maximum repeatedly, it will wear out faster. However, if you only stretch it a little bit each time, it will maintain its elasticity and last longer. Similarly, partially using and recharging a battery preserves its life and performance."	The unhealthiest state for a battery is 100% but also 0% because quite literally all the electrons are on one side... That is quite the uneven state... The way a battery works in general is you move electrons from one side to the other electrode so ideally you want to avoid those uneven states. If you have that happen, over time crystallisation can happen, making battery cells unusable and even making them bloat and prone to exploding the healthiest state for a lithium ion battery to be in is somewhere around 50% which is why you also find your new phone somewhere around 50% charge in the storage when u buy it. . Or a bit less because the battery after all drains with time... This is no accident, really more a measure to keep the battery safe in storage for longer. Many companies tend to have protective mechanism there. Some give features that prevent your phone from reaching those too high or too low areas. Others just plain do it and not tell you. Meaning your 100% and 0% isn't exactly the truth.

"If I give you a few boxes of books and say ""I think I put dune in this box, can you check? "" then it takes time to check each book and see if it's the book I want. If you're a librarian, though, and I ask ""do you have dune in the library? "" the librarian can tell you quickly, because they've already gone and catalogued every book they have. Google search is like that - the part most people see is the search page, but there's a hidden part to their technology: their web indexing ""spider"" downloads, on a regular basis, a huge percentage of the web, and stores information about what the page is about, what keywords appear on it, and so forth, in a huge index. Then, when you search, the query is farmed off to a bunch of servers which each search part of that index and return pages that it deems are relevant."	Google can search the web in less than a second and return many results due to a highly efficient system called indexing, while windows file explorer takes longer because it searches in real-time without an index for most queries. Imagine a library with thousands of books. Google creates an index (like the one found at the back of a textbook) for almost every webpage on the internet. When you search for something on Google, it refers to this massive index and quickly serves you the relevant webpages. Google continually updates this index, so the results are current, and it can provide answers almost instantly. On the other hand, windows file explorer doesn't have a comprehensive index of your files (in many cases, only certain folders are indexed). Instead, it searches your files and folders from scratch each time you make a search. It's like going through each book in a library to find a specific topic, rather than using the index at the back. This process takes more time, making windows file explorer searches less efficient than Google's method.

Books, newspapers, and magazines are printed perfectly all the time, why is it such a hassle to get home printers set up? Software is buggy and hard to work with even for professionals, and the hardware is always having issues. Home printers have been around for a long time and in general modern software is quite sophisticated. This seems like something we would have figured out by now. Even in offices, it’s hard for it to set up printers. Why haven’t we gotten printers that just always work? Is there some fundamental problem we can’t solve?	Home printers are often less reliable than industrial printers for books, newspapers, and magazines because they are designed for different purposes, have varying levels of quality, and face different expectations. First, home printers are made for occasional low-volume printing, whereas industrial printers are designed specifically for high-volume, consistent use. Because of this, industrial printers have more robust and durable components that can handle the demands of prolonged usage, while home printers are less sturdy. Second, home printers tend to be more affordable and have lower-quality components. This means that they might not operate as smoothly or efficiently as their industrial counterparts. Lastly, home printers have to cater to a wide range of users with different skill levels, which can complicate software design, leading to potential bugs and issues. Industrial printers usually involve specialized, trained experts to operate and maintain them. Overall, the differences in purpose, quality, and user expectations contribute to the frequent issues experienced with home printers.	"In addition to what has been mentioned already, the printer subsystem in windows has been a tangled mess since forever. I used to work in printer tech support and when windows 10 came out I really hoped they had made some improvements, but no. Even the simple act of canceling a print job depends on the goodwill of the driver, but the reason for wanting to cancel it is often that the driver pooped its pants and the job got stuck. Windows should be able to detect this and enforce action, but you still have to fix it by hand. Printer ""ports"" is also a concept dating back to windows 95 or maybe even earlier, and they frequently get messed up for no good reason, or because the driver tries to be helpful and work around the archaic system, with another system which is completely opaque to users and thus a mess to troubleshoot."
38	ee002f86-8771-4086-9552-73cb55946bc2.txt	How are programming languages... Programmed?	"Programming languages are created using tools and existing languages, and then translated into machine code that computers understand. This process can be understood in two main parts: creating the programming language and using it to write programs. To create a programming language, developers first define its syntax (grammar and rules) and semantics (meaning of the different elements). They then write a compiler or interpreter for the language. A compiler is a program that translates the code written in the new programming language into machine code, which is a set of instructions that the computer can directly execute. An interpreter, on the other hand, executes the code line by line, translating it into machine code as it goes. These compilers and interpreters are often written in an existing programming language, like c or c++. For instance, the first version of python, another programming language, was written in c. Once a programming language has a compiler or interpreter, it can be used to write new programs. When you write a program using a programming language, you're creating a set of instructions in that particular language. The computer doesn't ""know"" the language itself; it only understands machine code, which is a series of binary numbers (0s and 1s). When you run your program, the compiler or interpreter translates your code into machine code, which the computer can then execute to perform the desired tasks. So, in summary, programming languages are created using existing languages, and the compiler or interpreter translates those languages into machine code for computers to understand and execute."	"The CPU of computers have, hard coded into then, a set of instructions that define the kinds of operations that computer can perform. For example, adding two numbers. These instructions are coded in binary. For example, the instruction to add two numbers in memory (along with an optional constant) might look like:0010000xxxxxyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzwhere the x's represent the location to find the first number. The y's represent the location to find the second number, the z's represent the third constant, and the 0010000 is what tells the computer that this is an adding operation. This is not a particularly intuitive representation. So instead we might want to represent it with something more like language, like:""add x y z""but now we need a program that converts ""add x y z"", which we understand, into ""0010000xxxxxyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"", which the computer understands. So we make a program that does that, directly programming it with machine code. This is how *assemblers* came into being. This slightly-higher-level language was called assembly and the programs that would convert assembly into machine code were assemblers. Higher level languages make the commands even more sensible and memorable, translate into multiple machine-level instructions with a single high-level command, and also optimize and streamline code. The first high level languages would have been programmed in assembly, along with the programs to convert the high level language into machine language, called *compilers. *today, we use high level languages to make *other* high level languages."

Yes, electric heaters are essentially 100% efficient when it comes to converting electrical energy into heat. This is because all the energy input (e.g. , 1500w) is converted directly into heat, without any significant losses. Unlike other electronic appliances, where heat is considered a loss during the conversion of energy, in electric heaters, generating heat is the primary goal. Therefore, if a heater consumes 1500w of electricity, it will produce 1500w of heat output.	Yes, electric heaters convert 100% of the power that they consume into heat. So they have an efficiency of 100%. Heat pumps move heat from one area (outside your house) to another area (inside your house) the amount of heat they move is typically about 3 times more than the power they consume. So the in terms of energy-to-heat efficiency, they are 300%+ efficient. But thermodynamically they are not “creating” heat from nothing. So heat pumps are not perpetual motion machines, they don’t break any of the laws of thermodynamics.

Couldn’t someone intercept the text and get into my account?	Two-factor authentication (2FA) via text messages is indeed less secure than other methods, such as authenticator apps or hardware tokens. However, many companies still use SMS for 2FA because it's a more user-friendly option, as most people have a mobile phone and do not require any extra software. While it's true that SMS can be intercepted by attackers, this risk is relatively low compared to the convenience it offers. Additionally, even if someone intercepts the code, they would still need your password to access your account, adding an extra layer of security. In summary, sms-based 2FA is a balance between ease of use and security. More secure methods exist, but they might require additional setup or equipment, making SMS a practical option for the masses.	As mentioned in another comment, SMS isn’t as secure as a dedicated authenticator app. But it has a couple of advantages. - not everyone has a smart phone and so can’t install a dedicated app. - authenticator apps can be a pain when you move to a new device. Some will transfer over, others may not. Sms doesn’t have this problem. - almost everyone knows how SMS works, authenticator apps are a bit more complex. Less technically minded people may have trouble installing, setting up, and transferring codes. - even with SMS being less secure, it’s still more secure than nothing at all. Every extra layer or step the attacker has to go through decreases your chance of getting compromised. It’s just not the best step to take.
41	849aa4b7-1f11-4801-bfba-382ff6e467fa.txt	Why are fridges in cold climate countries not mounted into the wall of a house so the ambient air could cool the inside?	Fridge design essentially revolves around maintaining consistent and ideal temperatures for preserving food. Using ambient air to cool the inside of a fridge in cold climate countries is not as simple or effective as it might initially seem, due to various factors like temperature fluctuations and structural concerns. Firstly, outside temperatures are not stable and can vary greatly throughout the day and across seasons. A fridge needs to maintain a consistent temperature, usually around 37°f (3°c) for the main compartment and 0°f (-18°c) for the freezer section. Relying on ambient air would make it difficult for the fridge to maintain these temperatures consistently, especially during warmer periods. Secondly, implementing such a design would involve complex engineering solutions that could increase the cost of construction and make it less practical. It would require a well-insulated system to incorporate a fridge into the wall, along with specialized ventilation to bring in cold air only when needed, and a way to prevent heat from escaping the house when the fridge is not in use. Additionally, doing so could potentially lead to moisture build-up and condensation issues inside and around the fridge, which may cause mold and dampness issues that affect the surrounding structure. In summary, while using ambient air to cool a fridge in cold climate countries might theoretically save some energy, the practical challenges and potential problems of regulating temperature, engineering complexity, and potential moisture issues make it an impractical solution compared to the more controlled environment provided by a conventional fridge.	I have lived in houses without fridges or where the fridge was too small where we did this. The pantry is usually in the corner of the house so it gets cooler or even an outside pantry. The problem is that there is very little temperature control. In the summer temperatures can get quite high even in cold climates so the pantry would become room temperature or even higher. And in the winter you might risk frost in this pantry which destroys a lot of food. So it requires constant attention to the temperature and it might not be fully usable for large parts of the year. Having a fridge inside is not a waste of energy in cold climates. The fridge will dump its excess heat into the room which means you do not need to heat your house as much using other means. Even the overhead from the compressor and such that gets got from use will end up as heat inside the house, which is where you want it. In fact split fridges is something you see in warmer climates, commonly industrial fridges, where you do not want to heat the inside of the house. So you can actually save energy in a warm climate by having the radiator on the back of the fridge stick outside the house. But in cold climates this would just waste energy.

What makes the console ""stick"" on the last given instruction, rather than cutting to a color or corrupting the screen?"	"Older cartridge games freeze on a single frame instead of crashing completely due to how the hardware and software in classic game consoles are designed. In these systems, the hardware is generally simpler, often running just one program at a time, and lacks the features that modern systems possess to handle crashes gracefully. When a game crashes, it usually means that the software running on the console has encountered an error or unexpected situation that it cannot handle. In older consoles, the system's processor executes a sequence of instructions given by the game's software. When an error occurs, the processor may get stuck in an infinite loop or waiting for an instruction that never comes, thus rendering the game unresponsive. Since the game is in a frozen state, the console continues to display the last generated image (or frame) on the screen, simply because it hasn't received further instructions to update the image. The visual data remains unchanged, so the screen appears ""stuck. "" on the other hand, modern systems have built-in error handling mechanisms, such as resetting the hardware or displaying an error message, which prevent the system from freezing on a single frame. In summary, older cartridge games freeze on a single frame due to the simplicity of the hardware and software design, which lacks error handling mechanisms that would otherwise reset the system or display an error message."	"The way games usually work is that there is a large part of the executed code to calculate the game world (i.e. Where is everything, what values does everything have, what is the next step for the AI, etc.), and then render the scene in one go and update the screen with that new scene rendition. The graphics card will just put on screen whatever it was last told to output, forever. So if any of that fails, you are stuck with whatever the latest ""update the screen"" did. In modern software, the game runs in a container, which is monitored by the operating system, and as soon as a crash is detected, the OS will kill that container, present a nice error message to the user, and then continue on as if the game was never started. In older consoles, the game was basically taking direct control of the console's hardware, including the graphics card, so if the game crashed there was nothing there to detect that crash and order the graphics card to display something else. Same goes with input controllers etc., so your only option was to unplug the power supply and reboot the console."
43	5a930d80-5819-43a7-9d1b-70768d9d70ea.txt	"Why is using ""goto"" considered to be a bad practice in programming?"	"Using ""goto"" is considered bad practice in programming because it can lead to unstructured and difficult-to-maintain code. Goto statements allow you to jump from one point in your code to another, bypassing the normal flow of control. While this can sometimes have its uses, it often results in what's known as ""spaghetti code,"" where the flow of control becomes tangled and hard to follow. Instead, it's better to use structured programming constructs, like loops and functions, to organize your code into a more manageable and logical structure. To understand why using ""goto"" can be problematic, let's first consider how normal code flow works. In structured programming, code is typically organized into a series of instructions that are executed sequentially. When a decision needs to be made, or a specific task needs to be performed, the program will call a function or use a loop, which helps maintain a clear and logical structure. These constructs make it easier to understand what the code is doing and makes it simpler to maintain and extend. However, when you use ""goto"" statements, the normal flow of control is disrupted, as the program jumps from one section of code to another. This makes it difficult to trace the flow of the program, as you can't predict what order the code will be executed in. This can lead to unintended consequences and makes it harder to troubleshoot issues. Let's take an example to illustrate the point. Imagine you're writing a choose-your-own-adventure story, where you list numbered paragraphs for different events in the story. At the end of each paragraph, you can provide choices and refer the reader to different paragraph numbers according to their choices. Suppose instead of clearly structured choices, you just simply tell the reader to go from paragraph 5 to paragraph 23 and then to paragraph 2. In this analogy, using ""goto"" would be like making these random jumps between paragraphs, making the story confusing and hard to follow. Instead, we want our story to flow logically, like structured programming with functions and loops. To summarize, using ""goto"" is considered bad practice because it disrupts the natural flow of code execution and makes it difficult to follow the program's logic. This can lead to code that is difficult to maintain, troubleshoot, and extend. Instead, it's better to use structured programming constructs like loops and functions, which result in more organized, logical, and maintainable code."	"The idea that ""goto statement considered harmful"" came from an essay by dijkstra that was published in 1968 during the dawn of computer science. His basic case was that goto was too primitive to have a single easily understood function when seen in code. It tells the machine to arbitrarily move control to a different instruction at a different line of the program but says nothing about why or what's going to be there. Also since you need to physically start reading somewhere else in the code with the context of what's in memory from the previous location in mind it can make programs extremely hard to read and verify, especially in an age before ides and debuggers. It allowed for too wide of a gap between the mental model of a static program and a dynamic running process. He advocated instead for what he called ""structured programming"" which is really just programming as anyone born after maybe 1964 understands it. Structured programming makes extensive use of this new-fangled idea from the late 50's called ""blocks"", because someone had to invent the idea of: if (true thing) { dothings(); } else { dootherthings(); }at some point. With blocks that's just the way you write that code with the instructions immediately blocked inside the condition that allows their execution to proceed. With goto those lines could be 600 lines away. And without another goto to send you back to where you left off, you'll just keep going from wherever you ended up until the program exits or crashes. Goto also predates a lot of the looping structures we take for granted in modern programming and while it could be used to implement them, using the actual loops instead carries more meaning and makes your program easier to read, understand, and compile (compilers that translate human-readable source to machine-readable machine code can make certain optimizations in how it feeds instructions into the CPU... As long as it understands what the loop does). So at this point while a lot of the readability issues would be countered by modern tooling, the adoption of more structured ways of writing code and more nuanced looping statements makes goto... Kinda pointless."

The main reason for the rapid advancement in technology recently is due to the accumulation of knowledge and resources over time. For thousands of years, humans were focused on survival and meeting basic needs, which didn't leave much room for technological innovation. Also, early societies were isolated from each other, which made it difficult to share and build upon existing knowledge. The pace of technological advancement started to increase with the development of complex societies, trade networks, and communication systems. This allowed ideas and knowledge to spread more easily, leading to new inventions and innovations. The industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries marked a turning point, as new machines and manufacturing techniques fueled rapid advancements in technology. In the 20th century, computers and the internet brought about even faster progress by making it easier to share and access information. Today, we're able to build on past discoveries and collaborate with people around the world, which makes technological advancement happen much more quickly than in the past.	The ability to produce excess stuff allowed more human resources to be focused on new technology and methods. This further increases productivity (since we started at a low level) and this frees up even more human resources to do new stuff. Prior to the industrialization, most (say around 80-90%) of the world's population had to work in agriculture (or very nearby occupations - transportation, etc) simply to feed societies. This kind of economic system is very sensitive to weather etc and things like hunger, disease and famine were not uncommon. Basically the vast majority of human effort went to provide the basics like food and shelter - education, science etc were restricted to a small elite. The industrial revolution meant that transportation became much easier, things like cloth became easier to produce, labor moved from farms to cities. Cities are a great form of organization for human interaction and innovation.

Why do they spend all the resources on building and running them?	Google benefits from offering free services without ads by attracting more users to their ecosystem, creating brand loyalty, and promoting their paid services. By providing free tools like docs, sheets, and drive, they make users more likely to use other Google products, pay for increased storage, or upgrade to Google workspace, which includes premium versions of these tools for businesses and organizations.	There is an enterprise version of those products for businesses that is pretty profitable. Getting a user base familiar with those products makes it a compelling reason for a business to adopt them over office 365 or something else. Also, Google drive has storage limits. If you exceed then, you need to pay. Docs, sheets, emails, etc all contribute to your storage limits.

It works by having a little microphone right next to the speaker listening for the outside noise that you want to cancel, then playing the inverse of that signal into the speaker, such that the two sound waves should cancel each other out. It can drain the battery more quickly than without since it needs to be doing active processing of the microphone signal to do this.	Noise-cancelling headphones work by using microphones to pick up external sounds, then generate opposite sound waves to cancel out those noises. This process, called active noise cancellation, requires a power source to run the built-in microphones and noise-cancelling circuitry, draining the battery faster compared to regular headphones. So, while effectively reducing external noises, the advanced technology does use more power and can result in shorter battery life.

"When you see a checkbox that says ""I am not a robot,"" it's actually part of a security tool called captcha (completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart). The purpose of captcha is to differentiate between human users and automated bots. Instead of just checking the box, the system looks at various signals, such as mouse movements, typing speed, and browsing history, to determine whether the action is being performed by a human or a bot. By assessing these factors, captcha can make it challenging for automated bots to pass the test. This helps prevent spam, ddos attacks, and other malicious activities that bots can perform when impersonating a human."	The issue isn't ticking the box. Ticking the box only initiates the process, and it checks for a few things to see of your recent browsing behavior has been natural and human enough. This is why it takes a small while to actually get ticked after clicking, and also why sometimes, despite you being definitely browsing normally, it also asks you to click stop signs, and crosswalks: just a triple-check. Among other things, it checks if you navigated websites normally, it checks if your mouse behavior is sloppy-ish, and whatever typing speed you get. This isn't perfect, either, as some bots still get through, but it catches the really bad ones, which helps a lot.

I told her it uses stealth technology, which makes it invisible to radar. She asked me how that works.	"Stealth technology is a way to make planes, like the b21 bomber, harder for radar systems to detect. To understand how stealth works, we need to know how radar functions first. Radar systems send out radio waves, which are a type of invisible energy, into the air. If these waves hit an object, like a plane, they bounce back to the radar receiver. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, the radar can determine where the object is and sometimes even its speed and direction. Now, stealth technology aims to make an aircraft ""invisible"" to radar by reducing the amount of radio waves that bounce back towards the radar system. It does this in two primary ways: one, through the aircraft's shape, and two, through special materials used on the aircraft's surface. The shape of a stealth aircraft, like the b21 bomber, is designed with many flat and angular surfaces. This helps break up and scatter the radio waves in different directions, so fewer of them return to the radar. Additionally, the aircraft uses special materials that can absorb some of the radio waves, further reducing the chance of detection. So, while stealth technology doesn't make an aircraft literally invisible, it significantly reduces its visibility to radar systems."	"So imagine radar being a really big speaker making sounds so loud we can't hear it. They are loud enough that any planes nearby cause the sound to echo back to the radar and that's how they detect things. The stealth bomber however uses special materials to absorb as much of the sound as it can so it can't echo back to the radar. It's also designed with a special shape in mind so that any sounds that aren't absorbed are echoed in directions other than the radar site. This way even if some of those sounds reach back to the radar it doesn't look like a big plane and could be mistaken for something else or at least not a threat. Edit:just to be clear I used sound here as an analogy because it's easier for someone young to imagine as waves that bounce off surfaces. Radar projects a radio frequency. It's an acronym for radio detection and ranging. Sonar on the other hand does use sound. Edit 2: for more adult readers please replace the word ""loud"" with ""high pitched""edit 3: thank you for the award! ! !"

I've always seen it on some devices and games (like terraria) where you specifically have to configure the port too so that you can successfully connect a server. But never truly understood what it was.	"A network port is a virtual ""doorway"" that allows data to enter and exit a computer or device over a network connection. Imagine your computer as a big building with many doors (ports). Each door is assigned a unique number and is dedicated to a specific type of service or application. When you use the internet or play a game like terraria, the data being sent and received is organized into packets. These packets are labeled with port numbers to ensure they make it to the right ""door"" on your computer. So, when you configure a port for a game, you're telling the game which doorway to use when sending and receiving data. There isn't a specific cable or wire for each port. Instead, the data is transmitted over a single network connection, like a single road leading to the building, with traffic signals (i.e. , port numbers) directing the packets to the correct doors. In summary, a network port is a virtual concept represented by a unique number and is used for organizing and directing data between your computer and the network. It does not involve distinct physical wiring or connections for each port."	Think of it like a big building with many apartments. The building has a street address. That is basically equivalent to the ip address of your computer. But since there can be many tenants (services) in the same building, you also need to know the apartment number. More technical explanation: many services (e.g. Email server, web server, file server, print server, etc.) can be running on the same computer, sharing the same network interface and therefore the same IP address. To keep those apart, each service is listening on a different port (e.g. \`25\` for email, \`80\` for web server, etc.). When you send a TCP/IP message, you have to specify the recipients ip address, but also the port on which the message is to be received. Ports are a logical concept. They physically use the same cable as all other messages. It's just an additional number encoded in the TCP/IP package. When your operating systems network stack receives such a message, it will read the port number and forward the message to whichever service (tenant) is currently holding that port.

Could you explain the technical differences between these two display server protocols, and what impact they have on performance, security, and user experience?	In a nutshell, xorg and wayland are two different display server protocols used in linux-based operating systems to manage how applications interact with the computer's graphics hardware and present their output on the screen. Xorg is an older protocol with a long history, while wayland is a more modern protocol designed to address some of xorg's limitations. To understand the differences between xorg and wayland, let's first look at how display servers work. Display servers act as the middleman between the computer's graphics hardware (like your computer's graphics card) and the software applications (like your web browser, video player, or video games) that display information on your screen. Display servers are responsible for handling user input (like keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen), managing windows, and drawing graphical output from applications to the screen. These tasks are fundamental for graphical interfaces, like the ones we use in our everyday computing experience. Now let's dive into the differences between xorg and wayland:1. Performance: due to its age, xorg was not designed with modern graphics hardware in mind, which leads to unnecessary steps in the communication process between the applications and the hardware. This can result in performance inefficiencies in certain scenarios, like slow window movement, resizing, or refresh rates. Wayland, on the other hand, was built with present-day graphics hardware in mind and implements direct rendering, which eliminates some of the middleman steps, facilitating communication between applications and hardware. The outcome is more efficient and smoother graphics performance. 2. Security: xorg has some inherent security issues, which mainly stem from its design that allows any application to access the input and output of all other applications on the display server. This can potentially enable malicious applications to capture or manipulate sensitive user information. Wayland improves on this by adding strong isolation between applications, meaning that an application can only access its own input and output data. This approach significantly reduces the attack surfaces for potential security threats. 3. User experience: in terms of user experience, the differences between xorg and wayland might be subtle for most users. As mentioned earlier, wayland might offer a smoother experience in certain cases, thanks to the improvements in performance. However, xorg currently offers wider compatibility and better support for some applications or hardware components, as it has been around for longer. To wrap up, xorg and wayland are two display server protocols used to manage the way applications interact with your computer's graphics hardware. While xorg has been the predominant choice for many years, wayland offers several advantages in terms of performance, security, and a modernized design approach. Nonetheless, choosing between the two protocols largely depends on user preferences, hardware compatibility, and the specific requirements of applications you rely on.	"All of these are about windowing systems. A program doesn't draw windows and buttons on your screen on its own, it talks to something else to do that. On linux, that's x11 or wayland. On mac that's quartz. On windows you rarely see it discussed, but it's called ""desktop window manager"". Xorg is a program that implements the x11 protocol for the x window system. ""xorg"" is the name for a particular program that does this particular thing, just like there's more drawing programs out there than photoshop. There exist other programs for it. For instance on MacOS, the equivalent program is xquartz. The x window system hails from 1984, almost 40 years ago. And computers changed a *lot* since then. X does a bunch of things in ways that these days are not quite optimal or obsolete, and a lot of the functionality that's part of the spec is almost entirely unused, but still kept because somebody might actually dig up some old software that needs some bit of ancient functionality. Over 40 years this has become quite burdensome, and so wayland was started to do a fresh start with none of the inconvenient legacy. ""wayland"" is the name of the protocol itself, just a spec for how to talk to a program that puts a gui on the screen (more or less). Wayland is implemented then by a bunch of different ""compositors"", which are the actual programs that do the work. This includes gnome, kde, etc. Wayland is a fresh start, and fits modern hardware much better. A lot of the people that originally worked on xorg moved on to wayland, and these days xorg can be considered nearly abandoned. Wayland took a lot of time to actually get off the ground, but these days should be considered as the thing to use, unless you really need x for some reason. As far as things like security and performance, wayland is the better one. X11 allows programs to peek at each other (so for instance a rogue program can capture what you're typing even if it's not the active program you're typing into), while wayland forbids this. Wayland also commits to a ""perfect frame"", where every frame is always drawn without any kind of tearing. X11 can have tearing in games or things like Youtube videos if things align the wrong way."

I found it weird that a wireless technology happens to be faster than a payment method that has actual physical contact with the payment reader. It just seems like it's the other way around. Like most things are faster when they have a direct wired connection or in this case physical contact but somehow when paying, inserting the chip takes longer than the contactless payment method. Why is that?	Contactless payment methods are faster than inserting a chip due to differences in the underlying technology and specific transaction steps involved in each process. With contactless payments, the card or device only needs to communicate with the payment terminal for a brief moment using near-field communication (NFC) technology. This allows for quick transfer of essential payment information, without the need for further authentication like a signature or pin entry. On the other hand, chip cards, while more secure due to physical connection, must go through extra steps for verification before completing the transaction. When the chip is inserted, additional back-and-forth communication occurs, sharing unique encrypted codes to verify the authenticity of the card. This process generally takes longer compared to the contactless method due to the extra layers of security involved. Thus, contactless payments prioritize speed, while chip card transactions emphasize security.	The time is not spent by the machine communicating with the card. When you do chip and pin the card machine is communicating with the bank or credit card provider, and checking that the card is genuine and can afford the payment. This takes non-negligible time. In a contactless payment the vendor doesn’t check the card and just takes a risk that it isn’t genuine. The transaction will be settled up at the end of the day. This is why there are generally limits on the value of transaction that you can do contactlessly; it protects the vendor from being left out of pocket for a large sum. *edit: this answer is eurocentric. I understand that the technology may be different in other places, though in that case I doubt there would be a noticeable difference in speed. *
52	24ebbb52-fad8-4b47-9d82-2f97a76a7478.txt	How do publishers of ebooks prevent piracy?	Ebook publishers use several methods to prevent piracy, which mainly involve digital rights management (DRM) and watermarking. DRM is a technology used to restrict access to and usage of copyrighted material, such as ebooks. In simple terms, DRM is like a lock that prevents unauthorized copying and sharing of ebooks. When you purchase an ebook, you're usually given a key (in the form of an account or device authorization) to unlock and read the book. This prevents users from easily sharing the ebook file with others, as they will not have the necessary key to open it. Some popular drm systems used for ebooks include adobe's adept and amazon's kindle drm. Watermarking is another technique ebook publishers use to deter piracy. Instead of locking the content like drm, a digital watermark embeds identifiable information into the ebook file. This information can be visible (like a logo or text) or invisible (embedded in the file's data). If the ebook is distributed illegally, the watermark can be traced back to the original purchaser, holding them responsible for the unauthorized sharing. Watermarking does not prevent sharing or copying of ebooks, but it acts as a deterrent by linking the piracy to a specific individual. In summary, ebook publishers mainly use drm and watermarking to discourage piracy, by restricting access to content or identifying potential sources of unauthorized sharing.	Some publishers try to only publish on platforms that take complete control of the distribution channels, file types, software and hardware to make it hard for people to copy the ebook without permission. Most famous of these distributors is amazon with their kindle ebook services. But others are doing the same. This does however make it harder for the customers to read the books unless they have the required hardware. And it does not completely prevent piracy. Other publishers make sure that it is easier and better service to buy the book outright instead of pirating it. There is not actually a very big market for pirated ebooks as there is for movies and TV series. So it can be hard to find pirated versions of the books you want, especially high quality versions. That makes the $3-10 for an ebook directly from the publisher a preferable deal to a lot of people. The people who do not want to pay this probably would not want to buy the book even if they did not find any pirated versions. So there is no loss in revenue to not implement any digital rights management.

"The wayback machine, part of archive.org, works like a giant digital library that stores snapshots of websites over time, making it possible to access older versions of webpages. It does this by using web crawlers, which are automated programs that ""browse"" the internet, taking periodic screenshots of each webpage they visit. To better understand the concept, imagine a robot taking pictures of every page in a book, capturing the words or images as they appear at regular intervals. Now, if changes or updates are made to some pages, this robot would go back and take new pictures, creating a visual record of how the book looked at various points in time. The wayback machine operates similarly with websites. As the web crawlers capture the content of each webpage, they store these snapshots in a massive database. The wayback machine then organizes these snapshots chronologically, allowing users to navigate through the stored copies by inputting a website's url and selecting a specific date of interest. It is important to note that the wayback machine doesn't capture every website or every update, but instead focuses on taking snapshots of a significant portion of the web. Some webpages may opt out of being crawled, and some may have been missed. Overall, however, it serves as a valuable tool for researchers, educators, and people interested in learning about the evolution of the internet."	"Technically - a server will imitate a browser and download a copy of the web page and save it in a folder with that day's date (somewhat simplified). Yes, it requires a lot of storage, so much so that they used to run tech tests for hard drive manufacturers and had a 6% per year drive failure rate as they worked so hard. Organisationally is more interesting. Brewster kahle sold a browser helper object (toolbar) called alexa to amazon. He saw that we were losing web pages as they were taken offline and that we were losing creative works and knowledge this way. He wanted to create a digital ""library of alexandria"" (which historically contained the whole of human knowledge before burning down! ). This was back in the late 90's, man was a visionary. His early mantra, in the days long before Youtube, etc. , was ""send us a copy of anything you make, we will host it for ever for free"". I saw brewster in london in 1997ish, and was totally struck by the scale of vision. BTW this is where Amazon got the ""alexa"" moniker from - the toolbar would watch your browsing and suggest similar sites based on other peoples browsing, early spidering suggestions for the web."

Loading bars may appear to load quickly at first and then slow down towards completion due to a variety of factors. First, the initial estimate of time to completion might be inaccurate, and as the process continues, the estimate adjusts. Second, some tasks require more processing time or resources than others, causing the loading bar to slow down during those tasks. Lastly, the visual representation of the loading bar may not always be perfectly in sync with the actual progress. These factors combined can create the illusion that the loading bar slows down towards the end.	Having built several of these things myself, I can tell you it's almost impossible to get these right. For example, suppose I make the percentage based on file size... It's out of my control if the last files take longer to load because they are on the worst part of the disc. It's also not in the loader's control if running the last part of the code takes longer. Bottom line, we try to make it run consistently, but between initial coding and final product, there are all kinds of things that can mess up our loading bar.

Tiktok is considered a security risk because it collects vast amounts of user data, and its parent company, bytedance, is based in China. The concern is that the Chinese government could potentially access this data, which could lead to user privacy violations, espionage, or manipulation. People are trying to ban it to protect personal information and national security, fearing China's potential misuse of the data for their own interests.	If you actually read the terms and service agreement for tik tok, you’ll find that you agree to give them full access to all the data on your device even for things outside of tik tok itself. You agree to allow them to harvest data from other apps including every keystroke you enter. Considering tik tok is a Chinese company, there are certain security risks involved with that.

In simple terms, devices like smartphones are given unique ids, such as IMEI numbers and MAC addresses, during the manufacturing process by assigning a unique sequence of numbers and/or letters to each device. These identifiers are important as they help in identifying and distinguishing one device from another, enabling communication between devices, and even securing devices against theft or misuse. Let's break down the concept of imei numbers and mac addresses to understand how they work and how they are assigned during manufacturing. IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to each mobile phone or smartphone. It is primarily used for identifying the device and helps in preventing theft, fraud, and unauthorized use. To understand how smartphones are given unique imei numbers, we need to first understand the structure of these numbers. An imei number consists of four parts:1. Type allocation code (tac): this is an 8-digit code that represents the manufacturer and the specific model of the device. 2. Serial number: this is a 6-digit unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer to each device in a model series. 3. Luhn check digit: this is a single-digit number calculated using the luhn algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the typed imei number. 4. Software version number (svn): this is an optional 2-digit number representing the software version of the device. When a smartphone is manufactured, the manufacturer assigns a unique tac for the specific model of the device. Within the production of that model, each individual device is then given a unique serial number. This process can be done manually or automatically through a computer system to ensure no repetitions. The luhn check digit is calculated and added to the imei, and if applicable, the software version number is appended. This complete 15-digit imei is stored within the device's firmware and is usually printed on a label under the battery or the device's packaging. Mac (media access control) address, on the other hand, is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal identifier assigned to a device's network interface controller (nic). It is primarily used for communication between devices over a network, such as WI-FI or bluetooth. A mac address consists of two parts:1. Organizationally unique identifier (oui): this is a 6-digit identifier assigned by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) to a specific manufacturer. 2. Device identifier: this is a 6-digit unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer to each device. In order to assign unique mac addresses to smartphones, manufacturers first obtain an oui from the ieee, which is uniquely assigned to them. Then, during the manufacturing process, each device's network interface is assigned a unique device identifier by the manufacturer. Similar to the imei assignment process, this can be done manually or automatically through computer systems. The oui and device identifier are combined to form the complete 12-digit mac address, which is stored within the device's network interface card. Both imei numbers and mac addresses are assigned during the manufacturing process to ensure that each device has a unique identifier. This assignment makes it easier to track, manage, and communicate with devices in various networking and communication scenarios.	"You're familiar with read-only chips and probably familiar with read-write chips (like those used for flash memory). What they don't talk about is write-once memory. You can write data to it a single time and that's it. How (in theory):imagine you have 8 fuses. We'll label them 0 through 7. You want to store a binary representation of the letter a, which is 01000001. So you blow fuses 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, leaving only fuses 1 and 7 intact. The thing is, there are two lines for each fuse: a read line and a write line. To read a fuse, you use the read line. To write to a fuse, you have to use both the read and the write line to burn the fuse. On the write line, there another, higher amp fuse. After you're done burning your fuses, you overload the write line without the read line and blow the fuse on the write line. No more writing. Only reading. (also, you'd put a fuse on the read line to prevent someone from trying to dump a bunch of current there to change one of the bits. )how (in practice):when foxconn or other manufacturers build devices, one of the steps with the partially assembled device connects a computer to specific connection points on the pcb which were placed there for this purpose specifically. These connection points are connected to the chip where the imei, serial, mac number, or other hardware id is stored. In older designs, you could later change the write-once content so long as you changed a 0 to a 1 only. While you couldn't set it to any value you wanted, you could change the value to something other than what it was previously. In more modern designs, the data is written and then current is passed through another connection point which disconnects the data lines for writing internal to the chip. How (the bad way):write-once chips are pretty specialized which translates as ""expensive in small quantities"". So, on cheaper devices or low-margin devices, the oem just uses flash memory to store whatever and the software on the controller on the device simply won't provide a way for the value to be changed. This doesn't prevent someone with proper knowledge and equipment to change the content of flash chips. This is how counterfeit sd flash cards and counterfeit usb flash drives are made. Someone buys a bunch of cheap 512mb cards and changes the content of the flash memory used by the controller so that the chip intentionally misidentifies itself to the computer as being 2tb. And so long as you don't try to use more than 512mb of space and don't format the card without using the quick format feature, you won't notice. (doing a 'long format' should catch this type of counterfeiting. )"
57	046f7fbd-3824-477b-bd52-0d9bdab90878.txt	Why are most disposable batteries cylindrical if battery compartments are usually rectangular? The most common types of disposable batteries (thinking AA and AAA) are cylindrical while battery compartments are usually rectangular. Wouldn't it make more sense to produce rectangular batteries with more volume, therefore, more capacity for the same sized compartments? Thanks.	Disposable batteries are mostly cylindrical because it's an efficient shape for storing and conducting energy, and it also allows for easier manufacturing. The cylinder is a structurally strong shape which helps contain the chemicals inside and can safely handle any internal pressure. The two ends of the cylinder can act as the positive and negative terminals, providing a clear and sturdy connection point. Additionally, cylindrical batteries can be easily manufactured, as the coiling process used to create the battery cell components lends itself well to this shape. Rectangular batteries would require a more complicated manufacturing process, which could increase the cost of production. Battery compartments are rectangular as it is a practical shape for accommodating one or more batteries lined up in a series to provide a desired voltage. It's also easier to design electronic devices with rectangular compartments that can fit efficiently into the overall design. While rectangular batteries may seem to have more volume and capacity, the benefits of the cylindrical shape in terms of structural integrity, ease of manufacturing, and good conductivity outweigh the potential advantages of a rectangular battery.	"To some extent it's for backwards compatibility. A, b, c & d cells (and the subsequent double or triple as) originated as zinc-carbon chemistry ones. The positive was a carbon rod down the centre of a zinc cylinder with the electrolyte in between. That was decades ago and things were designed round those sizes and shapes. Along came longer-lasting manganese-alkaline chemistry (duracell and energiser brands nowadays) that had to fit the same spaces if they were to sell. Even rechargeables like NiCad or NiMH had to be the same geometry for domestic use. Like a lot of other things (eg computer keyboards) people may think that there is a better way of designing something but its too late to change that once a standard has taken hold and commercially it becomes a chicken and egg situation. Can you imagine being an early-adopter buying something that uses a non-standard size battery that isn't widely available, or equally hunting round for ""old-style"" round batteries because your remote is three or four years old?"

"Main idea: companies can discover if your password has been leaked by monitoring data breaches and using ""hashing"" techniques to compare your password with leaked data while maintaining security and privacy. To understand how companies can discover if your password has been leaked, it's important to know how passwords are stored and what happens during a data breach. When you create an account with a company, your password is typically not stored in plain text. Instead, it is transformed into a unique and fixed-length series of numbers and letters, known as a ""hash. "" this process is done using a mathematical function called a ""hashing algorithm. "" the company then stores the resulting hash value, rather than your actual password. When you log in to your account, the company hashes your entered password and compares it to the stored hash to verify your identity. Now, if a data breach occurs and your password hash is exposed, the leaked data often includes these hash values. To check if your password has been leaked, companies like cybersecurity firms or password managers can monitor data breaches and maintain databases of leaked hashes. They do this by scanning the internet for data dumps and collecting known breached password hashes. To find out if your password hash is in the leaked database, the company would hash your password again and compare it with the database without ever having access to your real password. If a match is found, it means that your password has been leaked, and you would be advised to change it. In summary, companies discover if your password has been leaked by monitoring and collecting data breaches, and then using hashing techniques to compare your password hash with those found in the leaked data, ensuring security and privacy in the process."	There are large databases of all known leaked passwords and accounts. The biggest one is maintained by [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) . Companies pay these database maintainers for full access so they can check their customers passwords and recomend they change it. The databases do not store the actual password but rather a one way cryptographic hash of it. A lot of times the password itself is not leaked but a hash of it is leaked, but the databases are able to check any password against any hash as well. When it comes to companies who have been breached they have audit logs of what happens on their systems. If anyone is able to extract the account detals it will show up in these audit logs. If there is no audit logs or the logs themselves seams to have been tampered then they just have to assume the passwords have been leaked. It does require a lot of investigation after a breach have been discovered to find out exactly what have been extracted and what have not. A password hash might for example be stored in multiple places, in backups, session caches, etc. Some companies do not even find out their passwords have been leaked until the attacker leaks it by accident. Either by sharing a sample to someone claiming to be a buyer of the database but in reality works with uncovering such breaches, or through any number of ways they could accidentally leak the information.

The golden records were built ages ago, when technology wasn't nearly as advanced as it now!	How can text chiseled into stone longer than the text I write on paper? Voyages have a gold-plated copper record with a physical groove cut in them. They are on a spaceship in a vacuum that very little can do anything to them. There is no device that can play them back but instructions on how the data is stored. This is not comparable to a hard drive or an ssd. Hard drives have mechanical components that wear out and store data by magnetizer material, which is not permanent. Ssd store data trapped in floating gate transistors and they can leak out over time. Other electronic parts are also one and age for various reasons. Hard drives and ssd are built for quick storage and quick reading of data. The voyager disk took a long time to make a CD that is made in a factory where you physically shape plastic so there are pits in the surface and cover it with reflective aluminum is a lot closer to the voyager golden disk. Store them without scratching them at the appropriate temperature and they will last a very long time. But remember they are plastic that ager a lot more the metal. An important part si there is not device to read the disk, which would age and fail a lot faster than the metal disk.	The main reason for the longevity of the voyager golden records compared to modern hard disks and ssds is that they're made from different materials and use different methods of storing data. The voyager golden records were launched in 1977 on the voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. They're gold-plated copper discs that have audio, images, and other data etched onto them in a manner similar to a vinyl record. To read the data, a needle traces the grooves on the disc, and a mechanical or electrical system converts those grooves into audio signals or visual data. This format is highly durable because it's a physical, non-digital form of storing data, and it doesn't rely on electronic components that can degrade over time. In contrast, modern hard disks and ssds rely on electronic components and magnetic materials to store data. These components can degrade over time due to various factors, such as temperature changes, humidity, and physical wear-and-tear, which can lead to the loss of stored data. Since hard disks and ssds are designed for everyday use, they are not built to last for billions of years like the golden records. To put it simply, think of the voyager golden records like a sturdy, engraved stone tablet that can withstand the test of time, whereas modern hard disks and ssds are more like a piece of paper that can be affected by environmental factors and wear out over time with regular use.

In the final moments of the movie during the tickets are bought only during the last moment (I understand the last moment ticket purchase was dramatized for the movie). But was it possible to book a ticket for flight from iran from United states so quick without the internet?	"So, just because the internet didn't exist doesn't mean computers didn't. Back in... 1960? The sabre system was developed for American airlines. Essentially every booking agent had a dumb terminal into a mainframe computer. The airline would have a 1-800 #, or they would have an actual booking office in larger cities and at the airports they serviced. Travel agents who wanted to offer that airline, could subscribe to the airline's booking system and they'd literally plug their terminals over leased phone lines into the airline's mainframe. Immediately, every other airline went to ibm and the other big computer companies to develop competing systems. Over time, each system was bought or replaced by one or two of the major players; each surviving system generalized so it could service multiple airlines, have different features, planes, rewards programs etc. But same idea - you'd have a computer with a terminal into ""the mainframe"" and you were either an airline employee in a call center or at a desk somewhere, or a travel agency who subscribed to the service. In the internet days, the leased phone lines and dumb terminals gave way to remote clients over dialup or isdn and eventually into app-like smart clients, web delivered database apps."	Before the internet era, airline ticketing worked through a system involving travel agents, telephone reservations, and paper tickets. It was indeed possible to book a flight from iran to the United states quickly without the internet, although it required more manual and time-consuming steps. Travel agents typically used a global distribution system (gds) to look up flight schedules, seat availability, and fare prices from airlines. The gds was a computerized network that connected travel agencies and airlines, enabling agents to book flights for customers. To confirm a booking, travel agents would make a telephone call to the airline's reservation office or send a telex message to reserve the seats. Once the reservation was confirmed, the agent would manually issue a paper ticket, which was essentially a contract between the passenger and the airline. If a traveler needed to buy a ticket at the last minute, and they were not near a travel agent, they could call an airline's reservation center or purchase a ticket directly at the airport. In the case of the movie argo, it would be reasonable for the characters to buy last-minute tickets in 1979. They would have relied on a combination of travel agents, airline reservation staff, and airport ticket counters to secure their seats on the flights.
61	25bcf0b6-dde6-44fe-bc20-a0a8018606ce.txt	What practical use does the 'overtype' function on a computer serve? It honestly seems more annoying than helpful.	The 'overtype' function, also known as 'overwrite mode,' is a feature on computers that allows you to replace existing text with new text as you type. Instead of pushing the existing text forward like in 'insert mode,' it essentially covers it up with new characters. While it may seem annoying at first, overtype has practical uses for specific situations. For example, if you're working with a carefully formatted document where maintaining the text's structure is essential, overtype mode can help ensure you don't accidentally disrupt the layout. Additionally, when editing a pre-existing template with placeholders, overtype mode allows you to easily replace the placeholder text without shifting the surrounding content. Although less commonly used today due to modern word-processing features, overtype can still be helpful in certain document-editing situations.	Its more of a historic relic. Firstly, it probably came from typewriters, since typewriters had a similar thing going for them and a lot of our typing on computers evolved from typewriters. Two, insert mode is actually pretty expensive for computers to handle. To make space for a new character, in a file, you would have to shift all the characters after your cursor in that file down by 1 to make space, or have a more complicated scheme involving the computer keeping a record of inserted snippets and inserting them into the appropriate places when reading a file. On modern computers, this of course doesn't matter as much, they are plenty fast, but on the bricks from the 80s, it was very expensive. Overtype is simpler, you replace one character with another.

I also just saw a post in the minecraft sub about someone’s file corrupting and defaulting to 1/1/70. Why does this happen, and why that day specifically?	"Corrupted game files default to the 70's due to the way computers represent time. They count time in seconds since a specific date called the ""unix epoch,"" which is 00:00:00 on january 1, 1970.

However, due to time zones, a corrupted ""last played"" date might be set to december 31st, 1969 for some users. So, when a file gets corrupted and the date is lost, the system reverts to this starting point."	Modern computers are built on operating systems that date back to unix, one of the first operating systems on very early computers. Unix measures time [beginning at midnight on january 1, 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unix_time), so that's the date you'll see if the timestamp within your computer (which is just a number, despite how it's displayed to you) is equal to 0. Your 12/31/69 is probably ~~a -1~~ (edit: this time displayed in a utc-something time zone, as noted by commenters). This date, the *unix epoch*, shows up a lot when you're handling dates and fuck up - e.g. , [obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/376/).

Short answer - intense exercise causes changes to your circulatory system, especially in your legs. A rapid and sudden stop in intense exercise can cause a sudden problem with things like dizziness or loss of consciousness. Since treadmills are typically in places where a person who drops unconscious might get hurt and start a lawsuit. They incorporate a cooldown to help prevent this, and they can always blame you for misusing the machine if you ignore it.	The 5-minute cool down time on treadmills and elliptical machines helps gradually ease your body from high-intensity exercise to a resting state. Cooling down reduces the risk of dizziness or lightheadedness caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, as it aids the body in redistributing blood flow more evenly. It also helps with muscle recovery by minimizing lactic acid build-up, which can lead to muscle soreness. So, yes, a cool down is necessary and beneficial for overall health and well-being.

My wife would rather see my head in a box while I'm snoring. My snoring is loud and horrible. Why in the world can't I just buy a CPAP machine? I understand getting a prescription for drugs or therapies; some could be unnecessary or wasteful if given out with no one checking for symptoms or necessity. What makes a CPAP so special? It is an air blower machine, it blows air. Probably someone is making money by keeping CPAP behind the prescription curtain.	A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine requires a prescription because it is a medical device that can have different settings and pressure levels depending on the specific needs of the individual using it. These settings and pressure levels need to be accurately determined by a medical professional, usually after a sleep study or assessment, to ensure the device is both safe and effective in treating the user's sleep apnea or snoring issues. Using an incorrectly calibrated CPAP machine can potentially cause harm or exacerbate existing problems, such as insufficient oxygen supply during sleep or discomfort due to incorrect pressure. A prescription ensures that the machine is personalized for the user's specific condition and medical history, thus minimizing risks and maximizing benefits. Additionally, obtaining a prescription for a cpap machine typically requires a proper diagnosis, which can help identify any underlying health issues that may be contributing to the snoring or sleep apnea. By addressing these issues properly, patients can improve their overall health and sleep quality. In summary, the prescription requirement for CPAP machines ensures personalized and safe treatment, while also promoting proper medical evaluation and care.	Here's the FDA order migrating CPAP machines from class 3 to class 2. Https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/10/19/2018-22840/medical-devices-anesthesiology-devices-classification-of-the-positive-airway-pressure-deliveryclass 3 devices are the most highly restricted. The problem is by default new medical machinery made after 1978 is automatically classified as class 3. Class 2 are less restricted but still require a prescription. So far the fda has only done enough work to drop it to class 2. They're also likely trying to be conservative. Drop to class 2, wait a decade to ensure no problems and look at the problem again much later. Class 1 you can get over the counter. The fda needs to go out of their way to reduce the classification. This means someone needs to make the request and the fda needs to go through all their beaucratic hoops to lower classification. That means studies and research to prove its safe. That's time and money. And unless someone is actively advocating for it, is unlikely to happen. Bottom line, get your congress to revise 21 u. S. C. 360c(f)(1).

How do electronic thermometers, like the one in my car, measure temperature?	Electronic thermometers work by using special materials that react to changes in temperature by altering their electrical properties. One common type of electronic thermometer is a thermistor, which is a type of resistor whose resistance changes with temperature. A thermistor is made of ceramic materials like metal oxides, which are combined to create a component that reacts to temperature changes. As the temperature around the thermistor increases, its electrical resistance decreases. Conversely, as the temperature decreases, its resistance increases. This change in resistance can be measured and converted into a temperature reading. Here's an analogy: think of the thermistor as a road with variable speed limits that change with the weather. When it's hot, the speed limit is high, allowing more cars (or in our case, electrical current) to pass through quickly. When it's cold, the speed limit is low, causing cars to slow down and less current to flow. Electronic thermometers use a small electrical circuit to measure the change in resistance of the thermistor. The circuit then uses this information to calculate the temperature, which is displayed on a digital screen. In your car, this thermometer is connected to a sensor that measures the outside temperature, providing you with an accurate reading.	"There are many ""electronic thermometers"", e.g. :- resistance based (RTDs, thermistors): the resistance of effectively every material depends on the temperature. Measure it to deduce the temperature. Thermistors are usually semi-conductor based, while rtds are classical metal wires. - thermocouples: interfacing two different materials sometimes causes a voltage. This is most pronounced with doped semi-conductors, but there are many variants. Measure this (pretty small) voltage with a carefully designed amplifier to deduce the temperature. - thermal emission: not directly electronic, but everything emits thermal light radiation, usually from radio waves and ir to visible light and uv. Focus on one ""color"" (wavelength), measure the amount of light of this color something emits, and you can maybe deduce the temperature. ""maybe"", because you still need to know the absorptive behaviour the object has in that color; you can either measure it as well using an ir diode, or use a table of known values. - several more. For example you can measure the drop-off voltage of a diode, which depends on temperature as well."

"Microsoft word opens files in ""protected mode"" to keep your computer safe from potential threats, like viruses or malware, that may be hidden in the document. This mode restricts editing, ensuring that harmful content doesn't execute or compromise your system. By default, word opens files from unknown sources in ""protected mode,"" allowing you to review the file before fully enabling its features."	Word documents can contain embedded programs. These programs can do things like respond to clicks, or do things like have drop down lists for forms. It is a common ploy for hackers to embed viruses and malware into word files.

"When a computer program freezes, it's often because it's stuck in a loop or waiting for a resource, making it unable to ""think"" or detect its own frozen state. If it could restart itself, this would require a separate monitoring process to constantly check the program's status. Adding this monitoring process increases complexity and takes up more resources. Therefore, it's usually more efficient for users to manually force quit and restart the program when needed, instead of burdening every program with additional monitoring processes."	"The program almost certainly doesn't ""know"" it's frozen. In order to respond to an error causing the program to freeze the developers would have to know about the error and write code to handle it. Why, if they know about it, would they do what you suggest rather than fixing it or otherwise handle it more gracefully than the program freezing? Your operating system likely ""knows"" the program is frozen, but the os doesn't make the assumption that a user wants to kill and restart a program immediately when it freezes because, often, you don't."

And convenience. - you want someone in front who is able to swiftly make decisions on the possibility that the track control does something wrong. It seldom does, and if it does it's not certain that it's the train driver who is actually able to do something about it, that spots it in time. - when the track control system goes down (because a server malfunctions, because a radio tower goes down, because a power feed for a network switch dies, because the radio equipment in the train engine dies. And so on) it's going to create horrible delays for that specific train if you first need to get a driver to the train, before being able to instruct the train to manually override the (lack of or wrongful) instructions from the track control. The driver is actually pretty cheap per hour, compared to what the train operator pays for track access per hour.	Trains are not completely driverless primarily due to safety concerns and technological limitations. While the technology for driverless trains exists, incorporating it into various train systems can be challenging, and the risks associated with a malfunction are significantly higher than with self-driving cars. Firstly, trains often travel along complex routes with various junctions and signals that require human interaction to navigate safely. A driver must react to unexpected changes in the environment, such as fallen trees, track damage, or passengers who may be on the tracks. Although advancements in technology have made it possible to automate these decisions, it is still often considered safer to keep a driver in the locomotive. Secondly, there is a logistical challenge in upgrading existing rail networks to accommodate driverless trains. Implementing this technology would likely require substantial investment in infrastructure and safety measures. Lastly, social and regulatory aspects come into play. The workforce responsible for driving trains, and the unions representing them, would need to negotiate the transition to a driverless system, embracing the change and addressing potential job losses. In summary, while driverless trains are technologically feasible, safety concerns, logistical challenges, and social considerations have prevented them from

They hit an atom with a neutron, which breaks the atom apart into smaller parts and some more neutrons which will break apart other atoms. Whenever an atom breaks apart that creates a lot of energy. This energy in the form of heat heats up some water which turns into steam, which rotates a turbine, which is hooked up to a generator that turns the rotation into electricity.	A nuclear power plant generates electricity by splitting atoms, which releases heat. This process, called nuclear fission, occurs inside a reactor where fuel rods containing uranium produce heat. The heat is used to convert water into steam, which then turns a turbine connected to a generator. The generator produces electricity which is then sent to the power grid. In this way, nuclear power plants use atomic reactions to create a steady supply of electricity.

Drones, specifically quadcopters, have four blades (propellers) because it helps with stability and control. Each propeller provides lift, and by having four of them, the forces are distributed evenly, keeping the drone balanced. Two of the propellers spin clockwise, while the other two spin counterclockwise. This cancels out rotational forces, preventing the drone from spinning around and making it easier to control its movements. On the other hand, helicopters have one main rotor with multiple blades to provide lift and a smaller tail rotor to counteract the rotational force generated by the main rotor. The pilot can control the helicopter's movement by adjusting the angle of the main rotor blades and tail rotor. Helicopters can carry more weight and are usually larger than drones, but their design is more mechanically complex, requiring gears and linkages to control the rotor blades. Drones, with their simpler design, can be smaller and more maneuverable, making them suitable for various applications.	It boils down to drones having electric motors while helicopters have an internal combustion engine. The helicopter’s engine can only go at very high rpms (revolutions per minute), so you need a transmission system to reduce those rpms for the blade. You can’t really afford having four independent transmissions in a helicopter. A quadcopter has four independent electric motors which can turn at whatever speed required and so are connected directly to the rotors without any transmission. This makes for relatively easy control of flight by changing the speeds of different motors to move in the desired direction. A helicopter has another complicated system for adjusting the angle of the blade instead. Helicopter-size vehicles can’t yet be powered by electric motors because of battery size and weight limitations, but once we get there, helicopters will likely have four rotors too.

If your hard drive is almost completely full then it can have an impact. Your operating system may temporarily dump some of the values it's tracking in ram to your hard drive to make use of ram for something else to speed things up. If there's not enough space on the drive to do that, it could affect performance. If you have 1 tb drive and go from using 700 gb to 500 gb it won't make a difference with respect to performance, though.	Freeing up storage space on your computer can make it faster because it allows the operating system to access files and perform tasks more efficiently. When a hard drive is close to full, finding and saving files becomes more time-consuming because the operating system has to search through a crowded and fragmented space. By removing unnecessary files and creating more free space, you're helping your computer's operating system work more efficiently, like giving it a decluttered workspace. This results in a smoother and faster performance for tasks like loading programs, running software, and reading files.

"Torrent is a file-sharing method that allows multiple users to download and upload pieces of a file simultaneously, making the process efficient and fast. It operates through a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, where each user (or ""peer"") downloads and uploads small portions of the file to and from other users. To use a torrent, you need a torrent client, which is a software that manages the file-sharing process. The process starts with a torrent file or a magnet link, which contain information about the file you want to download, such as its size and a unique code (a ""hash"") that ensures the file's integrity. When you open the torrent file in your client, it connects to a tracker, which helps locate other peers who have the file you're looking for. While torrents are often associated with piracy, they are not exclusive to it. Many legal files, such as public domain works and open-source software, are also distributed through torrents. So, not everything pirated comes from torrents, and not all torrents are pirated content."	"Torrents work by breaking a large file into smaller pieces called ""pieces."" Each piece is then shared with other people who are also downloading the file. Instead of downloading the entire file from one person, you download small pieces from many different people at the same time. This makes the download much faster and more efficient, since you're not relying on just one person's internet connection. Each torrent file contains information about the location of all the pieces on other computers. When you download a torrent file, your torrent client software contacts these computers and starts downloading the pieces. As you receive pieces, you also become a source for others to download pieces from, allowing the file to be spread even further. Many torrents are used to distribute open-source software, public domain works, and other content that is legally and ethically shared. However, some people use torrents to share copyrighted material."

In the 1940s, planes used a device called an altimeter to measure altitude. An altimeter works by measuring atmospheric pressure, which decreases as you go higher in altitude. The altimeter converts the pressure readings into a height measurement. Because air pressure depends on many factors like temperature and weather conditions, pilots in the 1940s had to periodically calibrate their altimeters using known altitudes, such as the elevation of an airport. This way, they could ensure a relatively accurate reading of their altitude throughout their flight.	The easiest way to measure altitude is by measuring the air pressure. The higher you go the lower the pressure. It is a bit more complex then that. Moving air creates different presures over the hull then stationary air so you need a good place to measure the pressure at or compensate for it. Weather also affects the pressure so you need to calibrate for this, especially during landing. But in general a good barometer is the best way to measure altitude and is still used on airplanes today.

When you put in the original url and click “shorten”, it generates a new unique alphanumeric id to be the shortened url and then store the association between it and the original url in a database. Then when you visit the shortened url, it first hits the url shortener’s server, which looks up the original url and then issues a redirect to the original site.	Link-shorteners work by creating a unique, shorter url that redirects to the original, longer web address. They do this by assigning a unique id, like a code, to your long url, which gets stored in their database. When someone clicks on the shortened link, the service looks up the associated code in the database and redirects the user to the original url. This saves space and makes sharing long links easier on platforms like social media.

"* you are told to turn a device off and on to clear its memory and allow it to start fresh from a default state. * power supplies contain capacitors to ""clean up"" and smooth out the electricity supplied to electronic devices. Microcontrollers and other components have further capacitors for the same purpose. * capacitors store energy, and will release it even after the power supply is turned off. This may partially power some memory and cause old data to be stored. * therefore you are told to leave the device off for 10 seconds to allow all the energy to discharge, to allow all memory to clear for a full reset."	"When electronic devices are powered off, they often retain a small amount of electric charge within their internal components, like capacitors. Support advises you to wait 10 seconds before turning the device back on to give these components time to fully discharge. Doing this allows the device to start from a completely 'fresh' state, preventing any lingering issues from affecting its performance when it's powered back on. This process is called a ""power cycle"" and can help resolve minor glitches and software issues by resetting the device's internal memory and operations, much like refreshing a webpage when it's not loading correctly."

"A gateway, in the context of the internet, is a device or system that helps connect different networks together, allowing them to communicate. Think of it like a translator between two people who speak different languages. When you see the error message ""gateway timed out,"" it means that there was a delay or failure in communication between your device (such as your computer) and the gateway. This can happen for various reasons, like slow internet connections, high traffic on the network, or issues with the gateway itself. Ultimately, it signifies that your device couldn't get the information you requested within an expected time, and the connection to the gateway has been interrupted or stopped."	"When you contact a website, you rarely make a connection directly with the server you're trying to get information from. Your connection is often routed through a series of intermediary servers that ""route"" the traffic, they serve different purposes such as load balancing, filtering out spam and serving faster traffic in different locations, these servers are referred to gateway servers, as they are just ""gateways"" on the the way to your destination. If one of these servers fails to contact its destination, but you managed to make a connection to the gateway, it will respond with a 504 gateway timeout. This just means the gateway responded to you, but was unable to help you connect to the next gateway or destination."

How does the signal get sent back and forth from one side of the world to the other? Satellite or cable? Radio or fibre optic?	The same way that you can load a webpage hosted in a server on the other side of the world without much latency. Your phone connects to a radio tower with a base station. That base station is connected to a core network by some combination of fibre, copper cable, and radio waves. Once your phone call reaches the core network, it will work out which international partner the call needs to be routed to (we call these interconnects) and sends the call to that partners network. This is most likely by undersea fibre but it could be other forms of connectivity too. Once it's in the partners core network, the process happens in reverse to get to the phone of the person you're calling. It would be unusual for satellites to be involved these days, but it's certainly possible. Phone calls do not use much data and so you get low latency reasonable quality even half way across the world.	International calls, like the one you made from Australia to the UK, rely on a combination of technologies and networks to transmit your voice across long distances clearly and with minimal lag. The main technologies involved are undersea fiber optic cables and satellites. When you make the call, your mobile device connects to a local cell tower, which then sends the signal to a nearby switching center. This center routes the call through a series of networks, often using undersea fiber optic cables. These cables span thousands of miles across oceans, transmitting signals as pulses of light at high speeds. Fiber optic cables offer fast and reliable communication with minimal data loss, which results in the excellent call quality you experienced. In some cases, satellites might be used if cable connections aren't available. However, satellite-based calls generally experience more latency and lower signal quality due to the longer distances and signal bounce involved. In most cases, a combination of fiber optic cables and other land-based networks work together to provide clear and non-laggy international calls.

I realise (/think? ) that CPUs essentially treat two different voltages as a 1 or 0, but what stops us from using 3 or more different voltages? Wouldn't that exponentially increase the CPU's throughput by allowing for decisions with greater than two outcomes to be calculated in one cycle? This would presumably mean that a lot of stuff written for base 2 would need to be updated to base 3 (in this example), but I can't imagine that's the only reason we haven't done this.	"Wouldn't that exponentially increase the CPU's throughput by allowing for decisions with greater than two outcomes to be calculated in one cycle? Yes and no. It would allow the same hardware primitives to represent more information, because rather than just measuring ""is the voltage over or below x"" and getting a 0 or a 1, we could measure ""is it below x or above y or in between the two"", and get a 0, 1 or 2. But to do that, those primitives would have to be bigger and more complex, and changing or reading their state would have to be more precise, which means it'd be slower. So overall, you wouldn't really gain anything from doing it. One of the obstacles keeping us from making computers faster than they are is that it takes time for the voltage to stabilize in a transistor, when its state changes. And that problem would be worse if we needed the voltages to reach more precise levels. As it is, there's just one threshold it has to be above, for its value to be counted as a one. So it's ok if it's still a little bit wibbly, as long as it isn't so wibbly it risks taking us across that line. But if we add more thresholds (below this value means zero, above that and bellow *this* means one, above *that* means two) then we also require the voltage to be controlled more precisely. We can't allow it to be as wibbly as it was before. And that means we have to be more careful and take a bit more time to set it."	Computers use base 2, or binary, due to their reliance on electronic components, such as transistors, that have two primary states: on and off. These two states can easily represent binary digits (bits), with on being 1 and off being 0. Using more than two voltage levels would indeed allow for greater data representation and possibly increased throughput, but it also introduces more complexity and challenges in design and implementation. One major challenge in using multiple voltage levels is the increased risk of errors. Having just two voltage levels allows for clear distinction between 1 and 0, making it easier to build electronic components with high reliability. As you introduce more voltage levels, the distinction between them becomes smaller, increasing the likelihood of errors due to noise or fluctuations in voltage. This means that the system has to be more precise and error-tolerant, which can be more difficult and expensive to achieve. Another challenge is the complexity of the hardware and software required to work with higher base number systems. Most of our digital technology has been built with binary in mind, from basic circuit design to high-level programming languages. Transitioning to a system with more voltage levels would require a significant redesign of existing technology, which can be time-consuming, costly, and may not outweigh the potential benefits. Moreover, binary systems are relatively simple to design, understand, and work with. This simplicity has allowed for the rapid development of digital technology over the past few decades. Although the concept of using multiple voltage levels is interesting and has been explored in some research, the practical limitations and the wide adoption of binary systems make it difficult to justify a major shift from our current model.

Information and data are stored in pieces of metal and green boards, which are essentially computer components, using electrical signals and tiny circuits. These components include hard drives and memory chips found on motherboard circuits, also known as 'green boards. 'data is represented using binary code, a system of ones and zeroes. Each digit in this code is called a bit. Grouping eight bits together gives you a byte, which can represent larger amounts of information, such as a letter or number. An example of a component that stores data on the green board is a memory chip called ram (random access memory). This type of memory is temporary and stores information the computer is actively using. It does so by using tiny electronic switches called transistors. When a transistor is turned on, it represents a one (1), and when it's off, it represents a zero (0). The on and off states of these transistors store the binary code. For pieces of metal, like hard drives, the data storage process is different. Hard drives consist of metal disks coated in a material that can be magnetically charged. These disks spin, while a read/write head hovers above them. When data needs to be stored or retrieved, the read/write head magnetically charges or reads specific areas of the disk to represent ones or zeroes. In both cases, the end goal is representing information using binary code. The difference lies in whether the storage relies on electrical signals in circuits, like in ram, or magnetic charges on metal disks, like in hard drives.	A bunch of 1s and 0s (that are specifically arranged to describe the information) are stored in the form of anything that can be in one of two states, like a light switch. It's either up or down, on or off, 1 or 0. So the easiest example to explain is cds. The bottom of a cd is etched by a laser with tiny little dots, or, tiny little spaces with no tiny little dot. Then, an electronic device like a cd player is made so that it can see the arrangement of dots or no dots, and turn that information back into the form that humans can understand. Other forms of data storage work the same way, just with different methods of storing and retrieving the 1s and 0s. To go a little deeper and explain how something can be 1s and 0s... Take the alphabet. If you were to say 00000001 is a, and 00000010 is b, etc, and you had a wall of light switches and lights that went on and on and on, you could write messages by having the right lights on or off. Modern flash memory does the same thing, except the wall of lightbulbs is actually an insane amount of tiny transistors that push electrons around to indicate 1 or 0.

"Browsers drain a lot of RAM because they handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as loading multiple tabs, running extensions, and processing multimedia content. Over time, these tasks accumulate and can cause ""memory leaks,"" where the browser doesn't release ram properly. Memory leaks occur because of coding mistakes or system limitations. The released memory is still registered as in use, which means it's not available for other processes. This leads to the browser occupying more and more ram until rebooted. When you reboot the browser, it frees up the memory previously blocked by these leaks and starts fresh, allowing it to run more smoothly and with less RAM usage."	People in this thread keep mentioning memory leaks. This explanation is wrong. Browsers try to keep a copy of things you might need prepared in advance. Often if a browser feels snappy, it's because rather than waiting for the thing you asked for to be downloaded of the internet, they kept a copy from the last time you asked for it. In fact, for extra snappyness, they keep it in ram. Browsers like chrome assume that they are the main thing you do on your computer, and will shamelessly take up more and more memory on the off-chance that you ask for something they are keeping. It gives them that quick snappy feel, but also makes them memory intensive.

The compressor coil for your fridge and ac are going to have identifiable start up characteristics, and then the increased draw of them can be extrapolated vs the background levels of things like lighting that's relatively static. They may not be able to tell a toaster from a curling iron, but with a clever enough meter they can probably tell a blow dryer from a toaster based on the motor. Utilities have used (and use) both methods, as well as smart appliances that ""talk back"" to the grid for those sorts of things. The smart appliances are usually ""big"" appliances like your ac or water heater that you've agreed to letting them turn them down/off at periods of peak demand."	The electric company doesn't actually know exactly which appliances are using the electricity in your home. Instead, they use estimates based on statistical data and general patterns of energy consumption. To create these estimates, utility companies gather data from a large number of households, analyzing usage patterns and conducting studies on different types of appliances and their energy needs. They then group these appliances into categories such as air conditioning, major appliances (fridge, oven), etc. , and determine the average percentage of energy consumption for each category. When generating your electricity bill, the company takes your total energy consumption and breaks it down into these categories according to the percentage estimates they've determined. So, your bill reflects a general estimation of your energy usage, rather than a precise breakdown of which specific appliances in your home were responsible for the usage. Keep in mind that these are just estimates, and your personal energy consumption may vary depending on your individual habits, appliance efficiency, and other factors.

Often when i’m googling something i’ll go to a few pages, so I’ll click a link, and then use the back button to return to the search results and find another link. But sometimes the back button just reloads the page, and even tapping it multiple times doesn’t work. How and why do some websites do this? Surely it should be my browser that’s controlling if it goes back or not, rather than the website it’s on?	"Websites can manipulate the ""back"" button using a technique called ""history manipulation. "" essentially, the website adds extra pages in your browsing history, so when you hit ""back,"" you're really just navigating through these extra pages. This can be done through javascript, which is a programming language used in web development. When you visit a website that uses this technique, it inserts a redirect to the same or a different page before the actual content. So, even if it feels like the browser should control the ""back"" button, the website interferes by adding extra steps that give the illusion of the button not working properly."	"The website can use a ""filler"" (not sure if there's a term for it) page in between pages that automatically forwards to another page. Instead of going from page a to b (the desired page), it goes from a to c (""filler"" page), which executes a script to automatically redirect you to b. So when you try to back out from b, you hit c instead, which pushes you back to b. Usually, if you hold down on the back button, it'll bring up a list of previous pages in the sequence they were visited. You can usually see the redirect page in that list."

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is a massive tech company that requires a large number of employees to manage and maintain its various services, products, and operations. These employees work in specialized roles across diverse departments, such as software engineering, research, marketing, sales, and user support, to name a few. To understand why a company like Meta has so many employees, let's break it down into main areas:1. Software development: Meta operates numerous services and applications, including Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and the oculus virtual reality platform. Each of these services requires teams of software engineers, product managers, and designers to develop, maintain, and improve the platforms. They need to consistently update and optimize the software for better performance, user experience, and security. Example: a team of engineers might be responsible for developing new features on Instagram, such as improvements to the stories function or the addition of new creative tools. 2. Infrastructure and operations: with billions of active users, Meta must maintain and develop a vast infrastructure of servers, networks, and data centers to handle the enormous amount of data being generated, processed, and stored. Employees working in operations ensure the seamless functioning of these systems and handle any issues that may arise. Example: network engineers might work on improving the speed and reliability of the data transfer between user devices and Facebook servers. 3. Research and development: companies like meta are always innovating and creating new technologies. They require extensive r&d teams that include experts in fields like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and machine learning. These teams drive the development of cutting-edge technologies and solutions for Meta's products. Example: researchers in Meta's artificial intelligence lab develop algorithms to accurately identify and remove harmful content from their platforms. 4. Sales and marketing: meta generates a significant portion of its revenue from advertising. Teams of sales and marketing professionals are responsible for attracting businesses to advertise on Meta's platforms and optimizing the AD experience for the user. Example: a marketing team might work on a campaign to promote Facebook's targeted advertising options for small businesses. 5. User support and moderation: with billions of users worldwide, Meta needs a substantial team to handle user inquiries and moderate content within its platforms. These employees address various issues, such as helping users recover their accounts, reporting harmful content, and ensuring community guidelines are followed. Example: content moderators review and remove content that violates meta's policies, such as hate speech or misinformation. In summary, companies like Meta have many employees because they operate multiple complex systems and services that require specialized expertise across a wide range of areas. These employees work together in diverse roles to ensure the smooth functioning, innovation, and growth of the company.	"In my experience software companies lean heavily on product and project managers. To stay competitive in tech you have to constantly be trying to innovate (at least that's the idea), which takes a lot of people to come up with and plan out these projects, even if many never see the light of day. Beyond that, maintaining a tech infrastructure like that is very complex,, goes well beyond devs. You're talking lt for local systems and networks and for their actual hosting/website/apps. You've got devs for building features and fixing bugs, devops for deploying and managing those updates and changes, techops for investigating issues and reporting to devs/proactively monitoring for issues. That's not just for Facebook core products either, (which are a ton: fb, meta, insta, whatsapp, etc) Facebook also has a huge footprint in the open source community, in that they actively maintain many sophisticated projects they built for their products that are now used by millions of other products, like their react frameworks. Not to mention they heavily use other open source softwares and dedicate some resources to maintaining those as well (this is common courtesy for large companies + they now have influence over a project they rely on), such as pytorch. That's not even going into the loads of people team members that are there to preserve culture and act as an hr. Or the support teams that do content moderation and escalated support (I assume they outsource tier 1 support). Or their legal teams, ux/ui designers, marketing managers, account managers (sales), finance workers, etc etc. And of course, last but not least, a very intensive hierarchy that places hundreds of people that are just there managing the other people, and the relationships between the teams, since things get so unwieldy. Successful tech companies are incredibly convoluted and complex in my experience. Many times there are whole teams working on ""nothing"" because their part of the business is on its way out, or they were part of another company that was acquired, and in either case, someone in the middle hasn't gotten around to trimming the fat/reallocating those resources. Source: have worked for a faang company, other huge tech companies, now work as a private contractor bc of how fucking annoying these conglomerates are to work with"

Why do I sometimes see a commercial play for about 1 second, and then it cuts out and another compliantly different commercial plays instead?	In summary, this issue arises from a timing mistake or signal override at the broadcast facility. When you see a commercial cut out after 1 second and switch to another, it's usually a result of two main factors. Either there's a human error in the control room of the TV station where an operator accidentally triggers the next commercial too early, or it's because local affiliate stations override the national commercials with their locally sold ad spots. Sometimes, the timing for these local ads is a bit off, causing the abrupt switch between commercials.	Commercials could be from two or three sources. The network has a commercial there and the local station then cuts that one out and places a local one in its place. There are signals that tell them when a commercial is starting and sometimes the equipment starts the local one a little late. In Canada we see this more as a lot of commercials are replaced with Canadian versions vs US versions. In Canada we see very few of the US commercials during superbowl and the US stations are replaced with canadian ones.

In summary, both lithium batteries in electric cars and gasoline in traditional cars have their own safety concerns, but neither is inherently more dangerous than the other when proper safety measures are taken. Lithium batteries in electric cars store energy in a compact form, which enables vehicles to have a longer driving range. However, these batteries have some safety concerns. One major concern is thermal runaway, a chain reaction that occurs when a battery overheats, causing it to release more heat, further increasing its temperature. This can result in a fire or explosion. Electric vehicles (evs) are designed with safety systems that monitor the temperature and charge of the battery to prevent thermal runaway. Gasoline cars, on the other hand, store energy in the form of flammable liquid fuel. In the event of an accident or fuel tank rupture, gasoline can leak out and easily catch fire, potentially causing a larger and more dangerous fire than an EV battery. However, gasoline cars have been designed and regulated to minimize the risk of such fires through careful engineering and safety features. While both types of vehicles present their own hazards, it's worth noting that the likelihood of experiencing a fire in either an electric car or a gasoline car is quite low. In fact, the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) has concluded that there is no significant difference in fire risks between electric and gasoline vehicles. The key to maintaining safety in either type of vehicle is to follow proper maintenance procedures and adhere to safety guidelines.	On average there are 1529 fires per 100,000 gas vehicles and just 25 fires per 100,000 electric vehicles. I am a firefighter, we have had to look at ev's in detail not because they are catching fire at a greater rate, but because of the risks to fire crew on scene and the difficulty in keeping an EV extinguished. There are special storage and space considerations for an EV once it reaches a yard for insurance inspection and eventual scrapping too. An EV fire is toxic as hell (not that a gasoline fire is a delight either of course). We have to know and understand that if an EV catches fire in a rural or remote location, then it is likely that we will not have access to sufficient water for cooling/extinguishing. We can call for 'make tankers x' to have a shuttle system in place for deliveries of water in 6 ton loads, but at any typical motor vehicle accident you find yourself trying to manoeuvre in 14 ton tanker vehicles in a traffic jammed, restricted location and it becomes a serious hassle. In short, it appears that ev's are vastly less likely to catch fire, but when they do it's a pain in the arse. It's worth noting that ev's as modern high-tech vehicles have so many safety features too (compared to 100 years of gasoline vehicles) which would help with the incidence of accidents.

Scalpers use automated software known as ticket bots to quickly purchase a large number of tickets when they become available. These bots are programmed to complete the buying process much faster than a human can, giving scalpers an advantage over average consumers. Additionally, scalpers often work in teams and utilize multiple accounts or devices to increase their chances of securing more tickets. As a result, they end up with a significant portion of the available tickets before regular buyers have a chance to purchase them.	There's actually a surprisingly simple explanation for this. There was a news article a few years ago that showed that ticketmaster actually owned a lot of ticket scalping companies, so of course they had dibs on the tickets, and ticketmaster could crank their prices up even more, pretending that there were fewer tickets and more demand, and then making extra profits from whatever the scalping companies got paid for the tickets:https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/ticketmaster-cheating-scalpers-726353/

Computer processors can contain upwards of a billion transistors in the area approximately the size of postage stamp operating with a clock cycle of over a billion. How can something so powerful, intricate and complex be so reliable?	Computer processors, or central processing units (CPUs), are incredibly reliable despite their complexity and billions of transistors because of a combination of advanced manufacturing processes, quality control measures, and error-correcting techniques. Let's break this down into three key aspects: manufacturing, testing, and error-correction. 1. Manufacturing: the process used to create CPUs involves technologies developed over decades of research and refinement. The production of CPUs uses a cleanroom environment, which is a highly controlled space where air is filtered of dust and contaminants to maintain a pristine working environment. This is necessary because even the tiniest particle could damage or ruin the delicate circuitry within the CPU. The transistors themselves are made using a technique called photolithography, which allows for the miniaturization of these components to fit billions of them onto a small silicon chip. Photolithography involves projecting a pattern onto a semiconductor wafer covered in a light-sensitive material, known as a photoresist. The exposure to light changes the photoresist's properties, allowing the unwanted material to be etched away, and the remaining structure forms the tiny transistors. 2. Testing: as CPUs are manufactured, they undergo extensive testing to ensure that they meet the required performance and reliability standards. This process starts with the design itself. Before any actual manufacturing occurs, designers use specialized software to simulate the CPU's behavior and make sure everything will work as intended. Once the chip is manufactured, it is tested for defects and performance. Companies perform tests on individual transistors, connections between them, and the overall CPU operation. Anytime a defect is found, engineers can either discard the faulty unit or disable the problematic part of the chip and sell it as a lower performance model. This is called binning, and it helps to minimize waste while still allowing the company to make a profit from imperfectly produced processors. 3. Error-correction: finally, CPUS are designed with built-in error-detection and error-correction techniques to handle any potential issues that may arise during operation. For example, error-correcting code (ecc) memory is used to automatically detect and correct any corrupt data before it causes system instability. In addition, CPUS use redundancy, meaning they have multiple circuits dedicated to performing the same function. If one circuit fails or encounters an error, another circuit can complete the task, maintaining the processor's reliability. In summary, the impressive reliability of computer processors comes from a combination of advanced manufacturing, rigorous testing, and error-correction techniques. The manufacturing processes have been fine-tuned over time to reduce defects and create CPUS that can withstand years of continuous use. Testing at various stages of production ensures that only those CPUS meeting high-performance standards make it into consumer devices. And integrated error-correction features help maintain stability in the face of any unexpected issues that might arise during a cpu's operation. All these factors contribute to the remarkable power and dependability of modern processors, even as they pack billions of transistors into a tiny space.	"Yeah, CPUs really are a marvel to behold. The amount of work that has gone into the design is staggering. Everything from the design to the manufacturing is careful curated so that everything is **perfect**. Chip manufacturing plants are crazy. They have a huge amount of equipment and processes that keep the manufacturing room virtually completely free of dust and other contaminants. So much in fact, that they really try to limit human interaction because humans will greatly contaminate the room without proper preparation. We're talking full body suits, shoe wraps, the whole works. Then there's the clock speed. A CPU is, at a high level of abstraction, just a big circuit. The clock speed is essentially how fast you're letting the circuit attempt to do an operation. So they measure the speed of electricity through the circuit and then essentially tell the CPU how fast it can do operations. It's important because bits can be overwritten and an operation can be entirely corrupted by overlapping clock cycles. This is an incredibly precise measurement and they standard manufacturers set are actually relatively slow and extremely reliable. Over-clocking is when you tell your CPU that you're willing to accept a slightly higher risk of something going wrong but have your CPU work faster. And, most of the time, over-clocking is pretty reliable as well. Then there's something we call binning. Effectively, every CPU is thoroughly performance tested and if there are defects, then the CPU is ""binned"". What this means is that it will have the defective cores deactivated and then the CPU will be sold as a lower-quality or lower core CPU but with completely functional and reliable parts. And some CPUS will also come with a form of software to detect issues and attempt to fix them. But that's a bit above my paygrade, tbh. This is besides decades of intensive research and development to make everything more reliable. Transistors in CPUs are now measured in nanometers. In 2016, a 1nm transistor was made. Stolen from u/steelykins: ""and for perspective of size: the chemical bonding between two silicon atoms is around 0. 2nn. That means a 1nm transistor would be on the atomic scale, and using only up to 5 atoms (whether made using silicon or not)""the only thing that can really do some damage to CPUs is heat. So, we've developed good fans and good processes to store operational computers. With adequate heat circulation, CPUs can last for decades. For more info on that, go find u/afcagroo 's comment. They do a really good job on elaborating on how transistors might fail. Hope that helps! Edit 1: fixed the paragraph about the scale of transistors in CPUs. Edit 2: added section on mechanism failures."

"Verifying the checksum confirms the integrity of a downloaded file by comparing the file's unique ""fingerprint"" to a provided reference value. Imagine the checksum as a mix of numbers and letters representing the characteristics of your favorite smoothie. If any ingredients are missing or replaced, the code changes. When you download a file, you calculate its checksum and compare it with the posted value. If they match, the file is as intended. Although both file and checksum might be from the same source, their distribution might involve different channels or storage locations, reducing the risk of tampering."	A lot of people aren't getting the crux of your question. As you say the checksum and the file often come from the same site, this does nothing for increasing trust. However there are situations where you might retrieve the checksum from a trusted source and the file from elsewhere. If the file is big you could go get it via bittorrent then download just the checksum from the trusted site to check the file wasn't tampered with. But yes if you don't trust the source of the checksum it means little for you.

And how do they “dial in” new coordinates exactly?	"Artillery precision is achieved by combining advanced technology, accurate calculations, and extensive testing. First, modern artillery systems use computers to calculate the correct firing angle and force needed for a specific target. These calculations factor in variables like distance, elevation, and wind conditions. Second, GPS and other guidance systems help to ensure the projectile stays on course while in flight. Third, artillery units conduct extensive testing and practice to refine their firing techniques and make necessary adjustments. To ""dial in"" new coordinates, operators input the target's location into the computer, which recalculates the firing parameters. The combination of these elements allows artillery to hit targets with remarkable accuracy, even over long distances."	The most basic answer is math. The science of ballistics is all just math. The weight of the projectile, the angle it’s fired at, the charge of the propellant, the length of the barrel, gravity, wind resistance, temperature, the curvature of the earth, humidity, moon phase, (maybe not moon phase). All these things are factors that can be put in a calculation to accurately predict where that projectile will hit. The oldest forms of artillery like trebuchets and stuff were just tested a lot and they worked out how far they fired with all the variables. Modern guns are treated the same way but modeling that is a lot easier with computers now.

Is it something to do with video compression?	Yes, it's about video compression. MP4 files use advanced compression algorithms that reduce file size while maintaining quality. GIFs use an older, less efficient compression method, resulting in larger files. Comparing mp4 and GIF is like comparing a modern car to an old one; the newer car has improved technology making it more efficient.	Yes, a GIF contains every pixel of every frame. A video format generally contains only the difference between most back to back frames, with a fraction of the frames fully stored. The ratios and how it’s done will vary between formats, but yes it that video formats have better compression.

QR codes, short for quick response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that store information, such as a link or URL, in a pattern of black squares on a white background. Your phone camera reads these codes using a QR code scanner app, which decodes the pattern and extracts the data stored. The app analyzes the pattern by identifying rows and columns of tiny squares, translating the black and white arrangement into binary code, which is a series of 1s and 0s. This binary code is further translated into the corresponding url or text. Once decoded, the app automatically redirects you to the link or displays the information, making it a quick and convenient method to access data or websites.	A QR code is a barcode but in 2 dimensions. A barcode, when scanned in one direction, represents a set of numbers and/or letters. A barcode is easier for a machine to read than writing out the numbers/letters. If you scratch out text, you can't read it but a barcode can take a few scratches and scrapes while still being readable. A QR code stores more information than a barcode because it can use 2 dimensions to store numbers and letters. That's why it can be scanned and represent a hyperlink. They can also be smaller than writing out the entire link. They have some protections against damage but not as much as the simple barcode.

"Internet speeds are often advertised as ""up to"" a certain speed because various factors can affect the actual performance. For instance, network congestion, distance from the server, or the quality of your equipment can cause slower speeds. To get the full 1000mbps advertised, you would need gigabit-capable equipment, such as a modem, router, and ethernet cables all rated for gigabit speeds. Additionally, your devices (computers, phones, etc.) should also support gigabit connections for optimal performance."	"Wire speed is different from data speed. Basically, with all the encapsulation protocols and things that ""carry"" the data, there's *at least* a 5 or 10 percent degradation... *just because those 'lower levels' of transmission take up the other room+.

The power coming out of the outlet is alternating current (ac). The power your computer uses is direct current (dc). Your laptop's power brick is converting ac to dc. It is also stepping down the voltage from 120v is something more suitable for charging your laptop's battery. Typically 12v to 20v.	Computer chargers have big adapters called power supplies, which convert the high voltage ac power from outlets into low voltage dc power suitable for devices. Directly connecting a device to the outlet without an adapter would expose the device to high voltages, causing damage to the internal components.
94	4076c991-1703-4234-b62d-1f878017c5ae.txt	Why did video games need to be on channel 3 to work?	"Video games needed to be on channel 3 to work because older tvs and game consoles used a type of signal called radio frequency (rf) to send video and audio from the console to the tv. The TV would then ""tune in"" to the signal, like a radio, to display the game. Channel 3 (or sometimes channel 4) was the designated channel because it was usually an unused TV channel, minimizing interference with other stations. The game console would connect to the TV through a device called an rf modulator, which converted the console's audio and video signals into an RF signal the TV could understand. By setting your TV to channel 3, you were essentially telling the TV to ""listen"" for the game console's RF signal on that specific channel frequency, allowing you to play your video games."	It wasn't always channel 3, but basically old tvs didn't have fancy digital menus, they only had channels. So the designers chose to reserve a channel to display the input from an analog cable you'd plug in to the TV from your game console or vcr. That channel was usually channel 3 because its designated frequency was the same as that used by the console/game cables. Channel 1, 2, 3 and 4 were not always used in most markets, because the frequency bands used to transmit to those channels over the air were not very reliable. That's why channel 1, 2, 3 and 4 were often chosen to be the ones which used analog cable input, which was at the same frequency as those the channel was designed for.

There are a few important factors with sniping. 1) the bullet is going to drop, because of gravity. So the farther away from your target, the higher above your target you have to aim. Scopes *can* be adjusted for range, meaning that yes, if you know a target is 500 meters away you can adjust the scope so that the center of the scope is now adjusting for a 500 meter distance. *but* that's also not entirely accurate, since it can become harder to get the exact distance the farther away you are. 2) there is a thing called the *coriolis effect* - because the earth is spinning, the bullet will naturally move left or right. This isn't really something that's easy to account for since you can't really *see* the effect, it's just something you have to be mindful of. And the effect is not the same everywhere, and it's not the same if you're shooting more east-west than north-south. 3) and one of the *biggest* factors is wind. Wind that is blowing across the bullet can push it left or right. And there is also wind that blows up and down, too. And again, you can't necessarily *see* the wind. A person can use contextual clues if there's stuff blowing in the wind but if they are really, really far away from the target, the windiness where the target is might be different than the windiness along the bullet's path.	Snipers can miss their target for a variety of reasons, including factors such as wind, distance, elevation, and human error. Crosshairs in a scope are a helpful tool for aiming, but they do not automatically guarantee a perfect shot. Firstly, when shooting at long distances, snipers must consider wind speed and direction. Wind can blow the bullet off its intended path, making it difficult to hit the target. The sniper has to estimate the wind's effect and adjust the aim accordingly, but this estimation is not always perfect. Secondly, the earth's gravitational pull affects bullets, causing them to drop over long distances. Snipers must calculate how much their bullet will drop due to gravity and adjust their aim upward to compensate. The greater the distance, the more significant this effect becomes, and the more difficult it is to hit the target accurately. Elevation differences between the sniper and the target can also impact the shot. If the target is higher or lower than the shooter, the bullet's trajectory will be different than if both were at the same elevation. Snipers have to take this into account when calculating their aim. Lastly, human error is always a possibility. Factors such as fatigue, stress, or even slight movements can impact the sniper's accuracy. Sometimes, even the tiniest movement or inconsistency in setting up the shot can be enough to miss the target. In summary, despite crosshairs providing a helpful aiming tool, professional snipers must account for various factors that can cause them to miss their target, including wind, distance, elevation, and human error.

Frequency is directly related to pitch, so as frequency increases, pitch goes up too. Imagine sound waves like a slinky - when you stretch it out, the coils are spaced further apart (low frequency, low pitch). When you squish it together, the coils get closer together (high frequency, high pitch). Speeding up an audio track is like squishing the slinky, making sound waves closer and resulting in a higher pitch.	Sound is vibration of air. Pitch is defined by the number of vibrations per second. When you speed up an audio recording, you are speeding up the vibrations that happen every second, and therefore the pitch goes up. Edit: if something is speeded up from normal speed and the pitch *doesn't* go up in proportion (e.g. Youtube video speed), that is only possible because of audio processing to retain the original pitch.

Data breaches cost millions of dollars due to several factors, mainly involving damage control, legal consequences, and the loss of trust from customers. When a company's data is breached, they need to invest in extensive security upgrades and conduct investigations to understand the extent of the issue. Legal consequences can include settlements, fines, or lawsuits as the company may need to compensate affected customers or face regulatory penalties. Lastly, a company's reputation often takes a hit after a data breach, causing customers to lose trust and potentially choose competitors. This loss of business and customer trust can take years to rebuild, leading to long-term financial losses.	There are a combination of reasons that combine to result in those numbers. Depending on what nation the company is in, there are regulatory penalties that can be applied if its shown the company didn't take required precautions to protect the information. There are potential civil law suits from the people affected by the breach. There is a loss of business after a breach too. Customers are less likely to do business if they are worried their information is at risk. Other companies become more reluctant becuase they don't want the association. All of these factors can result in significant financial loss to companies that experience data breaches.

An unprotected WI-FI connection is considered risky, even when people use https websites, because there are different layers of security involved. To understand this, let's break down the concept into simple parts. When you connect to wi-fi, your device sends signals to a router, which then forwards your requests to the internet. Think of WI-FI as a road connecting your device to the wider internet. When you're using an unprotected WI-FI connection, it's like you're driving on a road without any guardrails. On the other hand, https is a secure way to access websites. It encrypts the information being sent between your device and the website, so it's difficult for hackers to understand the data being transmitted. In our analogy, using https is like putting a secure lock on a package you're sending through the mail. While https provides a good level of security for your data, it doesn't protect the actual connection between your device and the router. When you're on an unprotected WI-FI connection, hackers can potentially intercept the signals between your device and the router, giving them access to your device and any information you're sending or receiving – even if you're using https websites. So, it's important to use a protected WI-FI connection to ensure that both the road (wi-fi connection) and the packages (website communication) are secure.	"Between a secured public WIFI network and an unsecured public WIFI network, and assuming you're not using plain http or using other obsolete protocols, there are only a couple relevant differences:1. Resolving (looking up) hostnames is still most commonly done unsecured (and unencrypted). If you have configured your browser to use doh (dns-over-https), this doesn't apply to you, but most people haven't done that. 1. The initial connection to a webserver will include the hostname in plain text, before the connection becomes secured. This will be changing in the near future as more web browsers and web servers start to support secure sni/ech (encrypted client hello)in short, if you connect to an unsecured WIFI connection and were to view this page, other people on the network could see that you connected to ""reddit. Com"", but would be unable to see any details beyond that. They wouldn't see which page on reddit specifically you were looking at, what your username was, etc. , literally just ""reddit. Com"" and then a bunch of gibberish. If you connect to a *secured* WIFI connection, the network administrator would still be able to see ""reddit. Com"", but other users connected to the same network would not."

I don’t think I was ever taught this but thinking about it it seems like suck a futuristic concept and I wanna know how they both work. Like, how do these things send invisible, intangible signals?	Radio and WI-FI signals work by using electromagnetic waves to transmit information through the air. Think of these waves like ripples created when you throw a stone into a pond, but much smaller and spread out in all directions. In both cases, a transmitter generates these waves to send a signal, while a receiver picks them up to retrieve the information. The transmitter creates variations in the waves (amplitude or frequency) to encode the data. For example, sound in radio broadcasts or binary code (1s and 0s) in WI-FI communications. The waves travel at the speed of light and can pass through most materials, except for those that absorb or reflect them (e.g. , metals). This is why radio and WI-FI signals can travel through walls, but sometimes their strength decreases due to interference. To differentiate between radio and WI-FI signals, they use different frequency bands. Radio signals typically operate on lower frequencies while WI-FI uses higher frequencies (2. 4 ghz or 5 ghz). The frequency used determines some characteristics, like the distance signals can travel and how easily they are affected by interference. So, although these signals may seem futuristic, they are essentially a clever use of electromagnetic waves to transmit information wirelessly through the air.	"The ""invisible signals"" are electromagnetic radiation, same as visible light. It's just not a wavelength your eyes can see. That's the same category as microwaves, x-rays, uv light, infrared, etc. - it's all just colours of light your eyes can't see. For radio and wifi, the eli5 is that the data being sent is broken up into 1's and 0's (for wifi) or a wave representing the sound (for radio) and emitted as a pulsed/ flashing signal that travels out from the source in all directions, just like any other ""light"" does. Think of it like using a lantern to send morse code as dots and dashes using long and short flashes of light. Radio broadcast are doing the same thing, beaming out pulses of light (a colour of light we call ""radio"") across the landscape from their transmitter. Anyone with the right set of ""eyes"" for this colour - an antenna, can pick up this flashing light and decode the message back into a sound wave or digital data or whatever."
101	d5bbaae5-8f83-4d54-8079-414f742cca84.txt	How does laser cooling work?	Laser cooling is a technique used to cool down atoms and molecules by slowing them down using laser light. In simpler terms, laser cooling uses the power of photons (particles of light) to reduce the movement of particles, which in turn lowers their temperature. To understand how laser cooling works, we must first know that atoms and molecules are constantly moving, and this movement is related to their temperature. When they move faster, their temperature is higher, and vice versa. Laser cooling aims to slow down these particles, hence reducing their temperature. The process begins with particles moving in every direction. To slow them down, laser beams are directed at the particles from all directions. Now, when a moving particle encounters a laser beam, it absorbs a photon from the laser. This absorption changes the particle's momentum, causing it to slow down. The photons in the laser beam act like tiny brakes for the particles. However, this slowing effect wouldn't last long if the particle kept absorbing photons at the same rate. To counter this, a technique called doppler cooling is used. This technique takes advantage of the doppler effect, which is the change in frequency (or color) of light when an object is moving towards or away from its source. By adjusting the laser frequency slightly below the particle's natural absorption frequency, the particle preferentially absorbs photons when it's moving towards the laser. As the particle absorbs more photons and slows down, the doppler effect causes it to absorb photons less efficiently, thereby maintaining the cooling effect. Over time, the particle's movement slows down significantly, reducing its temperature to very low levels.	"Things to know/remember beforehand:* temperature is the random motion/bouncing around of molecules and atoms* light gets absorbed by atoms when the particles of light (photons) matches very specific kinetic energies that depend on the atom they're possibly getting absorbed by. This energy is directly related to the lights color (which is also it's frequency and wavelength). Otherwise the light just passed through without doing anything* if you are traveling towards the source of the light, you will see the light shift more ""blue"" (higher energy and frequency, shorter wavelength), opposite is true if you're moving away. This is called doppler shift* when a photon gets absorbed by an atom, the momentum and energy of the photon gets transferred into the atom (conservation laws)so, when scientists want to cool individual atoms with lasers, their goal is to slow down that random motion of the atom. What they do is set up a bunch of lasers that are tuned to emit light *just below* those absorption energies. This way, the light only gets absorbed when they're moving towards each other (like a head on collision) because the light gets shifted into those energies to absorb. The energy is conserved by making the electrons jump to higher orbits around the atom, while the atom itself slows down to conserve momentum. This causes the atom to cool to as low as a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero"

"Stoplights use sensors to detect when vehicles are present and then change their signals accordingly. These sensors are typically buried under the road called ""inductive loop sensors,"" or they can be mounted high above the intersection called ""traffic cameras. ""inductive loop sensors work by creating an electromagnetic field when a vehicle passes over them, signaling the presence of a vehicle. Traffic cameras use image recognition technology to identify when cars are waiting at an intersection. Both of these systems send information to a traffic signal controller, which manages the stoplights. The traffic signal controller analyzes the data from the sensors and determines when to change the lights. For instance, if it registers a long queue of cars waiting at a red light, it may decide to extend the green light for the cross traffic to clear the congestion. So, the stoplights work based on a combination of sensor-driven input and predetermined traffic patterns."	Many are just dumb lights and don’t know. They are on a timer — sometimes a timer that has a different schedule for light changes at different times during the day. Some of them do have a sensor, though. They bury wire coils in the pavement that can sense when a chunk of metal is over them. The metal in the car affects the magnetic field surrounding the sensors in the pavement, signaling that a car’s there (any big chunk of steel will do). That information is sent to a small computer in a box nearby that controls the light timing so that it knows to speed up the change because a car’s waiting (and, at certain times, this can be turned off and it will just use a timer and ignore the sensors).

How much data would be consumed in 1 hour for each?	Viewing a livestream and a normal video at the same resolution (e.g., 480p) usually consumes a similar amount of data. The key factor affecting data consumption is the bitrate, which determines the amount of data transferred per second. If both the livestream and the normal video have a similar bitrate, the data usage will be close. Assuming an average bitrate for 480p content of around 1. 2 mbps, you would consume approximately 540 mb of data per hour for both the livestream and the normal video.	No. The reason is because one way or another the data is streamed at 4 to 8mbit, the only difference is that with streaming the content is being uploaded at the same time it is being watched. It's like drinking water from a fountain and drinking water from a bottle. Either way you drank the same amount of water. The only differences come from if the stream is only available at lower bitrates/resolutions, such as 480/720p. But if the bitrate (quality) is the same there is no difference

Why do they ask you to remove batteries from your luggage?	Batteries, specifically lithium-ion batteries, are at risk of catching fire on planes due to a process called thermal runaway. When a battery experiences external factors like physical damage, heat, or electrical short-circuit, its temperature increases rapidly. This causes a chain reaction, producing more heat leading to a fire or explosion. On a plane, this can be a dangerous situation, as fire-retardant systems may not be adequate to contain it. To minimize the risk, airlines ask passengers to remove batteries from checked luggage and store them in carry-on bags or devices.	Lithium ion batteries are always a risk for catching on fireas a general rule, fire hazards are not permitted in the cargo compartment of passenger airlinesa fire in the cabin can be spotted and dealt with quickly. A fire in the cargo compartment runs the risk of not being caught until too latethe risk of fire is low but just putting batteries in carryon is a pretty minor step to ensure that the rare event is minor instead of serious when it does happen

How can it be that renaming the extension doesn't ruin the image format? Why do they even exist then? Obviously I'm just tired of constantly renaming downloaded files because I can't open them in discord or photoshop. It seems entirely unnecessary.	File extensions help software recognize the format, but the actual image data is stored inside the file. When you change the extension, programs like discord or photoshop are smart enough to look at the file's contents and recognize its true format. These new formats like webp and jfif exist to offer improved compression and quality compared to older ones like GIF and jpeg. Renaming them doesn't ruin the image, but software that only relies on extensions might not recognize them.	"The file extension just tells the os what program to use to open the file. The program that tries to open it is going to actually look at the file to see what it is. In virtually all cases, any program that can open webp or jfif also knows how to open GIF or jpeg, so when they open the file they just go ""oh, this is a jfif"" and keep doing their thing."

Data centers use water to cool down the servers which generate a lot of heat. While a closed-loop system could recycle water, it would become less efficient over time due to the increasing temperature of the water. Data centers need a continuous supply of cooler water to maintain the temperature and prevent overheating. By using fresh water, they can keep the cooling process more efficient. Additionally, water can accumulate impurities over time, adding maintenance costs to treat the water. Therefore, using a continuous source of clean, cool water is more cost-effective and efficient for data centers.	It depends on what the water is being used for. If it's being used for cooling, it is recycled in a closed loop. The water comes in and pulls heat out of the cooling units, then gets pumped to outside radiators with fans blowing through them. That cools the water, then it's pumped back inside, repeat. However, datacenters also use a lot of water to control humidity, especially in dry regions. That water gets evaporated and added to the air, because super dry air conducts static electricity way too easy, and static electricity is bad for computers.

I guess this is applicable to any social media platform or other similar systems. Is it because there are always bugs to address, so it’s never really running smoothly, or other reasons?	The main reason a social media platform can't run on autopilot without engineers is because it requires constant, active maintenance and updates to keep functioning smoothly. Here's a breakdown of why that's the case:1. Bugs and issues: no system is perfect, and issues or bugs will inevitably pop up over time. Engineers are needed to identify and fix these problems to maintain a smooth user experience. 2. Security: hackers and cyber criminals are always trying to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, so engineers have to continuously update security measures to protect user data and the platform's integrity. 3. Infrastructure: as user traffic increases or the platform's features expand, the underlying infrastructure (servers, databases, etc. ) must be upgraded or maintained to support the growing demands. 4. Feature updates: to stay competitive, social media platforms need to introduce new features and improvements regularly. Engineers are responsible for the development and implementation of these enhancements. 5. Compatibility: changes in technology or user devices (such as new phones or operating systems) may require updates to the platform so that it remains compatible and functions correctly. In summary, engineers play a crucial role in the ongoing maintenance, security, and development of a social media platform, which makes it challenging for the platform to run smoothly	The site is running smoothly *because* all the staff are constantly doing things. And it’s not just the engineers. Moderators are removing bad content, lawyers are responding to requests from governments, project managers are making sure projects run on time, and accounting staff are paying all the bills. It’s like saying “this hotel is running very smoothly. Why would it matter if 80% of the staff left? ” it’s the constant, almost invisible effort of the humans that keeps it going. Sure, the building isn’t going to fall down. But there’s not going to be enough staff left to wash and change the sheets, make guest keys, change the air filters, start the giant coffee pots in the morning, receive deliveries of soap, or pay the electric bill.

Banking apps are concerned about root access on your phone because it could potentially compromise the security of your sensitive financial information. Root access grants you complete control over your phone's operating system, allowing you to modify system files, settings, and permissions. While this can be useful for customization and additional features, it also carries a greater risk of exposing your data to malicious software or hackers. When you perform transactions in a banking app, the actual exchange of funds is indeed, server-sided. However, banking apps also store and process sensitive data on your device, like your account details, login credentials, and personal information. If your device is rooted, and you unintentionally install a malicious app or become a victim of a hacker, they could access and exploit this data. To protect the security and privacy of their users, many banking apps employ security measures that detect root access and block the app's functionality on rooted devices.	Yes, all transactions are sever side and you can't hack yourself in some money by manipulating your client. However, there is no way for the banking app to know that it is *you* that has root access to your phone. It might be you doing it or it could be a malicious program or attacker who has access to root. In that case a malicious actor could steal your money without you knowing. Think about it like an apartment building that requires everyone come in through the front entrance where they scan their access card and are seen by the attendant. There is a back fire entrance that can be propped open which bypasses that access verification but management doesn't like that. Not because they are concerned about *residents* using that entrance, but because they can't know it is only residents that are coming through.

Pretty much the title, and why do some take longer way longer than others?"	"Your computer has lots of storage space (like kitchen cabinets), but much less working space (like kitchen counters). You can't just keep all your groceries out on the counter or else you'll run out of room, so you need to put it all away into the cabinets. You can store everything when it's put away, but then you need to take it out and put it on the counter when it's time to use it. Your computer doesn't have enough ""counter space"" to have the entire game ready to go all at once, so it leaves a bunch of it in the cabinets until it's needed. The ""loading"" is what happens when the computer needs to put some parts back in the cabinet, and bring new parts down to the countertop so they're ready to be used."	"During the ""loading"" screen on games, programs, machines, etc. , the system is preparing and organizing the necessary data for proper functioning. It's like setting up a new room in a house by bringing in furniture, arranging it, and making sure everything is in the right place before letting people in. This process usually involves transferring data from a storage device (like a hard drive or ssd) to the computer's memory (ram) for faster access. The loading time varies depending on factors such as the size of the data, the speed of the storage device, and the processing power of the system. For example, a game with detailed graphics and a large world will require more data to be loaded, resulting in a longer loading time compared to a simple, text-based program. Similarly, an older computer may take longer to load a program compared to a newer, more powerful one."

Ticketmaster however is locked in to the biggest venues that feature the biggest artists, either because they have exclusive contracts or they outright own the venue. If you look at smaller venues than stadiums and arenas they often use different ticketing companies	Ticketmaster's dominance is due to exclusive contracts with venues and promoters, giving them control over ticket sales. Competitors struggle to break into the market because they lack access to these popular events.

Isn't there a point of no return vs the capacity of the population and the taxable income of the corporations?	The US debt ceiling can technically rise indefinitely, but doing so carries risks, such as increased interest rates and decreasing investor confidence. The government continually borrows money to finance operations, and raising the debt ceiling allows them to keep doing this. The US has a strong economy and the ability to tax its citizens and corporations, which supports its borrowing capacity. However, significant issues may arise if debt continues to grow faster than the economy itself.	The US is one of only a handful of countries (possibly 2, with Poland, although theirs is relative to their GDP so increases with growth) to have a debt ceiling or limit built into their laws. Most countries can legally just keep borrowing money as needed, subject to normal economic issues that governments face. Provided the US is capable of paying off the debts that are due there isn't really any limit to the amount it can borrow.

"Advertising is crucial for established brands like mcdonald's, wendy's, and household product companies like charmin and tide, for several reasons, including staying top-of-mind for consumers, warding off competition, driving sales and promotions, and maintaining their brand image. While these brands are well-known, continuous advertising helps them remain relevant, create excitement, and communicate necessary information to consumers. 1. Staying top-of-mind: one of the primary goals of advertising is to ensure that a brand stays at the forefront of consumers' minds. Even though people know about these brands, they are constantly bombarded with information and options. By consistently advertising, established brands ensure that they remain a ""default choice"" for consumers. A useful analogy for this would be a classroom teacher, who consistently reminds their students of important dates and assignments to ensure they remember and prioritize them. 2. Warding off competition: the marketplace is highly competitive, and new brands and products are introduced regularly. Established brands need to maintain their advertising efforts to fend off competition and retain their market share. For example, if mcdonald's were to stop advertising, it would risk losing ground to competitors like wendy's or burger king, who continue to aggressively promote their offerings. Advertising in this sense works like a sports game, where well-known teams need to keep playing and promoting their strengths to stay in the game and clinch victories, even though they are already popular. 3. Driving sales and promotions: advertising helps drive sales and promote new products and offers. For example, the 2 for 5 bk deal or the biggie bag from wendy's are promotions aimed at generating excitement and encouraging customers to visit the restaurants. By advertising these deals, the brands can attract new customers, incentivize repeat visits, and ultimately, drive revenue. Like during the holidays, stores advertise special discounts and deals to lure customers in, even though shoppers are already familiar with the stores and their products. 4. Maintaining brand image: advertising allows established brands to control and maintain their image by communicating their values, missions, and attributes consistently. For example, tide might continually advertise its cleaning powers, making sure consumers associate its products with effectiveness every time they see an ad. Think of advertising as a painter who constantly updates their art gallery, always ensuring their style and skills are on display to keep attracting visitors. 5. Adapting to changing habits and demographics: as time goes by, consumer habits and preferences change, and new demographic groups emerge. Advertising helps established brands adapt by targeting these new markets or promoting features that appeal to changing consumer needs. For example, fast-food brands might advertise healthier menu options to target increasingly health-conscious consumers. In summary, continuous advertising plays a significant role in keeping established brands relevant and top-of-mind for consumers, fending off competition, driving sales and promotions, maintaining their brand image, and adapting to changing consumer landscapes. Like changing the wheels on a moving car, advertising keeps these brands in motion and ensures they remain on course in the ever-evolving and fiercely competitive marketplace."	I worked in advertising for a long time. You're focusing on one metric - awareness. Are people aware the brand exists? So for these big legacy brands, you're right, they already have awareness. But that's not the only metric that drives sales. I'm going to break down some of the other reasons brands advertise. 1. **new product awareness** \- you may know swiffer exists. You might not know that they have a new re-fillable mop, for example. So doesn't matter that you know the brand exists, they want to let you know the new product exists2. **perception -** over time, the perception of a brand can change depending on what's going on in the world around them. So swiffer might be popular today, but there might be a lot of environmental awareness next year and suddenly people don't want disposable products as much. So then they'll re-position the same product, with something like, 'less hassle'. 3. **preference over competitors -** what drives a purchase isn't just knowing that a product exists. It's about believing it's better than their competitors. There's a subconscious thing that happens where things that we're familiar with we believe are 'better. ' so if tide didn't advertise for a few years, but gain did, people might start believing gain is better, simply because they see the name everywhere. This also includes having a better deal than competitors. So for car brands, for example, two competing brands might have two similar products, but one has better financing, so they'll advertise that. 4. **driving foot traffic -** some of the brands you mentioned, like wendy's or burger king, need people to actually go into a physical location to purchase. Sometimes having a 2 for 5 deal will drive people into the store who otherwise might not have gone5. **addressing sales dips** \- sometimes a brand's sales dip. This could be for any number of reasons. In this scenario, you do research to find the reason for it, and do advertising to let people know about your solution. So maybe if you're burger king, people stopped coming because they felt the inside was 'dirty', when really it was out of date. So you redesigned your interior, and the 2 for 5 deal isn't about that at all, it's to get people inside to see the new designthere are more reasons than this, but the gist is that people make purchases for a number of complex decisions based on the options available to them, not just whether or not they know something exists, and advertising is meant to respond to the current context in which people are making their purchases. These big brands spend a lot of money tracking the health of their brand in the market, how people perceive them, and their competitors, and advertise accordingly to what their research tells them is required to keep their sales up.

Prices are going up so let's put them up more by increasing the base level of interest. Why is this logical? What am I missing?	Increasing base interest rates is a strategy used by central banks to control inflation, which is one of the main factors contributing to the high cost of living. When prices rise too quickly, the purchasing power of money decreases, making everything more expensive. To combat this, central banks raise interest rates, which makes borrowing money more expensive. This means businesses and consumers are less likely to take out loans or use credit, effectively decreasing the demand for goods and services. As a result, prices are less likely to increase further since there's less demand. Higher interest rates also encourage people to save more, as they can earn more interest on their savings. This further reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy, leading to lower price levels. Overall, the main goal of increasing the base interest rate is to stabilize price levels and ensure that inflation doesn't erode the value of money, ultimately making the cost of living more manageable.	Increasing the base interest rate means that interest rates on all loans increase, making people and businesses take out fewer loans. Therefore they now don’t have access to as much money as they used to, and they can’t buy as much stuff. This means that the overall demand in the economy falls. And now from the basic supply and demand laws it follows that with constant supply and decreasing demand prices fall. That is, inflation is now getting lower, and costs of living don’t rise as fast. That’s the theory behind this idea, at least. How well it works out in reality depends on a lot of other factors, I guess. Tldr: with higher interest rates people who could only buy stuff by taking out loans can’t afford to buy that stuff at all anymore, and so some other people can now buy that stuff at a somewhat lower price.

If they have the money to ensure protection in the case of damage or loss that isn't guaranteed, why not save the money for when something actually happens?	eli5: why do people pay for insurance? If they have the money to ensure protection in the case of damage or loss that isn't guaranteed, why not save the money for when something actually happens? Insurance protects you precisely from damages you *couldn't* possibly afford to pay. When you buy insurance, you - in essence -buy **immunity from bankruptcy** (due to legal fees/liability payments/medical bills/<insert insurance type here>/etc....).	Insurance is a way for people to spread out the risk of potential financial losses. By paying a small amount each month, they are essentially joining a pool of others who do the same. If something bad happens to one person, like a car accident, the insurance company uses the pool of money to help cover the costs. This provides financial security to individuals, ensuring that they won't face huge expenses on their own in case of unexpected circumstances.

I feel like every time someone explains why stock prices matter to companies, they talk about some vague sense of future funding and attracting new talent, but I'm having trouble understanding why the price of stocks, which are already in the hands of the ""public"" (at least most of them are I assume?) matter so much that companies feel the need to lay off huge chunks of their workforce. Am I missing or understating the fundamental role that stock prices play in future operations?"	In essence, public companies worry about their stock price because it reflects the overall market perception of their value and can impact their ability to raise capital, attract talent, and conduct business transactions. Firstly, a public company's stock price represents the market's perception of the company's value, which takes into account factors like financial performance, growth potential, and market conditions. A higher stock price indicates that investors have a positive outlook on the company, and they believe it has high growth potential. Conversely, a declining stock price may signal that investors have concerns about the company's performance or prospects. The stock price can have a direct impact on a company's ability to raise capital. Higher stock prices make it easier for companies to issue new shares (called equity financing) to raise money. Since the company's shares are more valuable, they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount of capital. However, if the stock price is low, companies may need to issue more shares, which dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders and can lead to further declines in stock price. Attracting and retaining talent is also related to the stock price. Competitive compensation packages often include stock options, which are the opportunity to buy company shares at a preset price. If the stock price rises in the future, the options become more valuable, as individuals can buy the shares at the lower preset price and then potentially sell them for a higher market price. If the stock price is low or declining, these options become less attractive, making it harder to hire and retain top talent. Finally, stock price matters in business transactions, particularly mergers and acquisitions. If a company wants to acquire or merge with another company, they may use their shares as a form of payment. If their stock price is high, those shares are more valuable, making it more attractive for the target company to accept the deal. In summary, stock prices are crucial for public companies as they reflect investor confidence, determine the ease of raising capital, help attract and retain talent, and influence business transactions. Companies may feel the need to make significant changes, like laying off employees or restructuring, to improve their financial performance and regain investor confidence, ultimately aiming to increase the stock price.	"Why the price of stocks, which are already in the hands of the ""public""you seem to have the common misconception that there is ""the company"" which is its own self-contained entity that has sold shares to ""the public"" for its own ends. That is the wrong way to think about it, it will lead you astray. Companies have owners. It isn't necessarily the ceo, that is just a job like any other within the company. Instead the owners of a publicly traded company are people who own the ""stock"" of the company, sharing ownership (hence the name ""shares"" for the fractional units of ownership). The stockholders, the people who own the company, care about the value of the company. The total value of the company divided by the number of existing shares is the value of each individual share, and the owners of those shares obviously has a reason to care about how much they are worth. The owners exert their will by electing the board of directors. The board of directors hires the ceo, gives them general directions and goals to achieve, and if need be will fire the CEO if they aren't performing as desired. If the shareholders are not happy with the performance of the company they can replace members of the board of directors until the board shapes up. So the shareholders care about the value of their shares because it is the value of what they own at stake. The board of directors cares because their job and position is at stake. The CEO cares because it is their job at stake as well. Everyone else in the company cares because the CEO will make them care, again by their jobs being at stake. Overall ""the company"" cares about share prices because the company is owned by shareholders."

In a condo, you own a specific unit within the building, similar to owning a house but in a collective building. You'll have a deed, and you can sell, rent, or mortgage your unit as you wish. In a housing co-op, you don't own a specific unit, but rather a share in the entire cooperative. This share gives you the right to live in one of the units. You have a lease, not a deed, and selling or renting the unit is subject to the co-op board's rules and approval. Co-ops are more community-oriented, with residents often working together to manage the property.	"In a condo situation the individual owners own their units and the condo association owns the common property. Each individual owner contributes a share to the association and the association uses that money to maintain the common property. A condominium cannot restrict the rights of buyers or sellers. In a co-op the co-op owns everything and individuals buy a ""share"" of the whole - that share including their individual unit and a portion of the common property. Because the co-op owns the whole, they can legally refuse to sell to someone who doesn't meet the co-ops standards, because the person buying in isn't buying the unit as a separate entity, but the unit as a ""share"" of the whole."

I had a reading for my mba class tonight that was a piece written by Jeff Immelt, former CEO of General Electric, right before he left the company. The class discussion was probably the most animated discussion of the whole class so far. [the article](https://hbr.org/2017/09/inside-ges-transformation) on its own merits didn't seem controversial, as they were standard change management material, but emotions ran high during discussion, and I was confused.	The controversy surrounding general electric (ge) under jack welch and jeff immelt mainly revolves around their management styles, business strategies, and the company's performance during their tenures as ceos. Jack welch served as ge's CEO from 1981 to 2001 and was a highly regarded business leader. During his time, the company's market value grew from $14 billion to $410 billion. He achieved this through aggressive cost-cutting measures, extensive employee layoffs, and focusing on businesses where ge could be number one or number two in the industry. However, his management style was also criticized as ruthless and excessively focused on short-term gains, potentially sacrificing long-term growth and stability. Jeff Immelt took over as CEO from 2001 to 2017. He inherited a company with a heavy focus on financial services, which turned out to be a major risk during the financial crisis of 2008. Immelt tried to reshape the company by diversifying into different industries, such as healthcare and renewable energy, and investing in digital technology. However, the company's performance under Immelt was lackluster, with its market value declining significantly during his tenure. In the article you've mentioned, Immelt talks about the steps he took to transform ge during his time as CEO. While the article itself is focused on change management, it ignited a debate in your class because of the broader context of GE's performance and the legacy of both CEOs. Supporters of welch and critics of Immelt may argue that Immelt's leadership led to GE's decline, while others may argue that he inherited a difficult situation from Welch's aggressive strategies. This is likely what led to the animated discussion in your class, as opinions on the success or failure of these two CEOs and their respective strategies differ greatly.	Jack Welch created GE finance, which provided in-house finance for ge products. GE finance was *wildly* profitable, but there was a lack of understanding of the cause of this success among ge's leadership. They viewed ge finance as being the entity driving the company and invested heavily in it, while neglecting investment in ge's industrial arm. This set up for a situation where chronic underinvestment caused ge's product line to stall and quality to drop. By the time that welch left, he'd sort of set up a time bomb where ge products were rapidly becoming obsolete trash. Because ge finance's business was almost exclusively financing purchases of ge products, when ge's product line started to tank, ge finance tanked as well. This wouldn't have necessarily been a problem, because one thing welch did quite well was to turn ge into a major exporter and GE had built up a **huge** pile of overseas cash. Immelt inherited that cash pile and could have used it to revamp ge's product line. He didn't. An unwillingness to pay US tax on overseas profit caused Immelt to refuse to invest the money in US manufacturing. At the same time, a fear of foreign countries nationalizing ge overseas investments also stopped Immelt from investing in overseas production (and this was a well founded fear in the early 2000's - backdoor nationalizations were common at the time). So instead of investing the cash into GE's business, Immelt just let it sit in foreign bank accounts, doing absolutely nothing, and most of GE's business just sort of rotted away under him.

"Answer: businesses can participate in black friday sales without taking a loss by carefully managing their inventory, adjusting prices strategically, and using marketing tactics that create a sense of urgency. The main idea behind black friday is to create a surge in customer traffic and move a large volume of products in a short amount of time. To make this work without losing money, businesses employ a variety of strategies. 1. Inventory management: retailers plan well in advance, carefully considering which items will be put on sale during black friday. They may select items that have a wide profit margin, making it possible to discount them without losing money. Alternatively, they may put items on sale that are overstocked or have been sitting on shelves for a long time, clearing space for newer inventory. 2. Loss leaders: some businesses choose to temporarily lower the price on a few popular items, expecting to take a small loss on those items in order to bring in customers. These items are called ""loss leaders. "" the goal is to attract customers who will not only purchase the discounted item but also buy other, higher-margin items while they're in the store. 3. Strategic pricing: retailers may raise the base price of certain items before black friday, making the discounts appear more dramatic than they truly are, or they may create pricing tiers, offering deeper discounts on items that may have been sitting on shelves for a while. These tactics help to make the sale more attractive to consumers while still preserving profitability for the business. 4. Creating a sense of urgency: by marketing their sales as limited-time offers and using countdowns or limited quantities, businesses create a sense of urgency, encouraging customers to make quick decisions and impulse purchases. This psychology helps increase sales volume and potentially counteract any losses incurred from discounted products. To sum up, businesses participating in black friday maintain profitability by carefully managing their inventory, utilizing strategic pricing and marketing techniques, and incorporating loss leaders to lure customers into making additional purchases."	Let's say I normally sell a TV for $1000. It cost me $500 to get that TV from the manufacturer, and I get $500 profit from the sale of each TV as a result. I normally sell 10 tvs a month, and make $5,000. But on black friday, I lowered the cost of the TV to $800. It still cost me $500 to get that TV from the manufacturer, so I will only earn $300 for each TV I sell. But because of the sale that day, a lot more people are going to rush into the store and buy them. I will sell 20 tvs on black friday, and make $6,000 in a single day. I don't want to have that low of a price all the time, but every once in a while having an extra low price will dramatically encourage sales. Because it's a rare occasion, I will get more people willing to buy that TV on that day then if I just lowered the price in general. Likewise, if someone comes to my store to buy the cheap tv, they might also end up buying more accessories as well. They intended to just get a tv, but will also leave with a sound bar too. So that sound bar might only have a very mild discount, but because the person feels they saved money on the deal overall, they feel okay with also buying a sound bar. These contribute to making it very profitable to hold deals on black friday. You might only discount a few items, you might have something rare that will encourage people to go to your store and they will leave buying other things as well. Black friday makes a lot of money for a lot of businesses.

I see people on Tiktok, IG, etc, talking about borrowing against their life insurance policies and doing real estate investing. I am entirely ignorant as to how most financial things work, and I'm guessing posts of that nature are an attempt to prey on that ignorance in some way or another.	"In a nutshell: people can make money from their life insurance policies by borrowing against the policy's cash value or using it as collateral for a loan, which can then be invested in other ventures like real estate. There are two main types of life insurance policies: term life insurance and whole life insurance. Whole life insurance policies have a feature called ""cash value,"" which is a savings component that grows over time, in addition to the death benefit. Term life insurance policies do not have this feature. To borrow against a whole life insurance policy, the policyholder essentially takes out a loan from the insurance company, using the cash value built up in their policy as collateral. The policyholder can use the borrowed money for any purpose, such as investing in real estate or starting a business. The loan is typically paid back with interest, but if it's not paid back before the policyholder dies, the outstanding balance will be deducted from the death benefit paid to the beneficiaries. Additionally, a policyholder can use their life insurance policy as collateral for a loan from another source, such as a bank. This is known as ""collateral assignment. "" the lender will have a claim on the policy's death benefit if the borrower defaults on the loan. Again, the borrowed funds can be used for various purposes, including real estate investments. While there is some truth to people making money from their life insurance policies, it's essential to understand the risks involved and consult with a financial professional before using a policy for such purposes."	Whole life insurance policies accrue a cash value. Basically at any point throughout the policies life cycle you could cash it in for that cash value. That cash value is significantly lower than the payout of the insurance policy and it's based on a portion of your premium payments going into that cash value every time. These people are then using that cash value as collateral to borrow money against which is totally possible. The major failure point of this entire process is that whole life policies are basically garbage. They tout the cash value growth as a way to draw you in as a potential investment. But the reality is that the growth of those policies are typically extremely poor and most people in the financial sector would instead encourage you to buy a term life policy that would cover whatever you needed to. So yes these tick tocks you are seeing are accurate however they're using some flawed foundations to share that content with you. If for example somebody had bought you a whole life policy when you were a child and it has a crude cash value then you most certainly could tap into that but you should not go out and buy a whole life policy with the intention of doing this.

I’m 25 and I feel like it’s too late to ask.	A surety underwriter is a professional who works for an insurance company and assesses the risks involved in providing surety bonds. In simpler terms, their job is to figure out if it's a good idea for the insurance company to guarantee someone else's promise to fulfill an obligation or perform a task. To break this down further, let's first understand what a surety bond is. A surety bond is a contract between three parties: the principal (the person or company needing the bond), the surety (the insurance company), and the obligee (the person or company that the bond is designed to protect). It's like a safety net that ensures the principal will meet their obligation, and if they don't, the surety will step in and cover the loss for the obligee. Now, let's see what the surety underwriter does in this scenario. Their main responsibility is to review the applicant's (the principal's) financial and operational details to determine if the insurance company should issue the bond. The underwriter examines the applicant's credit score, financial history, work experience, and other relevant factors. Think of a surety underwriter like a loan officer at a bank. Just like a loan officer assesses if a borrower is likely to repay a loan, a surety underwriter evaluates if the principal is likely to fulfill their obligation. Both roles involve assessing risk, and the decision they make determines if the insurance company or bank is willing to take on that risk. The underwriter will also decide the terms and conditions of the bond, such as the premium to be charged and the amount of the bond. The premium, like an insurance premium, is a fee that the principal must pay for the surety bond. The cost to the principal varies based on the level of risk the underwriter believes the principal presents. In summary, a surety underwriter assesses risks, evaluates applicants, and sets the terms and conditions for surety bonds issued by an insurance company. They play a crucial role in ensuring the insurance company is not taking on unnecessary risks and safeguarding the interests of all parties involved. So, your dad's job is essential in determining whether or not the insurance company should act as a financial safety net for other people's promises.	"If I want to operate a business, sometimes there's a chance that I could screw up and break something really big. If I'm a doctor, I could prescribe something wrong or do a surgery wrong and kill someone. If I'm a car manufacturer, I could build a car that occasionally catches on fire and burns the people inside to death. If I pour concrete sidewalks, I could do a bad job and create a substantial tripping hazard (obviously not as bad as killing someone, but still a problem that costs more to deal with than the profit I make from that single job). &#x200b;in order to make sure that the people aren't completely screwed when they're victims of big problems that come from a business like that, states require that those businesses keep a big pile of money available to pay out if there is a big problem. That big pile of money is too big for most companies to keep sitting unused all the time, so the businesses buy surety bonds. Those aren't the same kind of bonds as ""stocks and bonds"" on wall street. They're bonds like bail bonds. &#x200b;if I have to keep $1 million aside in case of a catastrophe, I can go to an insurance company who will figure out how likely it is for me to screw up in that kind of huge way. If the insurance company thinks that there's a 2% chance that I'll screw up that big each year, they'll charge me maybe 2.5% of that million dollars each year and they'll pay the million dollars if I have that kind of big screw up. &#x200b;a surety underwriter is the person who tries to figure out how likely it is that my company will screw up in that kind of big way. Your dad is the person who says whether he thinks that I have a 2% chance of really screwing up or a 20% chance or a 0.01% chance of screwing up big time."

It seems perfectly natural and innocuous that those with the most information would want to profit from it, and doing so isn’t illegal anywhere else. So why is it prohibited to make trades based on information not everyone has? What undesirable thing does this prevent?	Insider trading is a crime because it undermines the fairness and integrity of the stock market. In a fair market, everyone should have equal opportunity to make informed decisions based on publicly available information. Insider traders use non-public, privileged information to gain an unfair advantage, which can harm other investors who don't have access to that information. This erodes trust in the financial system, discourages investment, and can even destabilize markets. To maintain a level playing field and protect the public, insider trading is therefore prohibited.	Insider trading makes the stock market unfair. Those with insider knowledge will always be able to take advantage of those without insider knowledge. Imagine if you could play poker against someone and the rules were that they could see your cards but you could not see their cards. You would know you could not win and would not play. So if insider trading were legal, no outside investors would invest in the stock market because it would be rigged against them. So there would be no stock market.

Throughout history, has there ever been a society that maintained 0% inflation for a long term while still maintaining a good quality of life?	To answer that question you need to understand what inflation is exactly. Currency and wealth are two different things. Wealth is stuff of value for human, either a product, a natural resource or a service. Currency is just something that help trade wealth. There is a relationship of supply and demand between the two. The supply is the currency and the demand is the wealth, because the more wealth you have the more you want to trade it with others. In general, wealth increase over time. The population increase so more worker, the technology and education increase so we are more productive, etc. So this mean that if demand (wealth) increase, but the supply (currency) stay the same, then the value of the currency will increase, which would be deflation. But if we add currency to the economy faster than the wealth increase, then we get more supply than demand, which lead to a decrease in the value of the supply (currency), we call that inflation. So as a country you can decide how much currency you want to add to the economy to control like a valve how much deflation or inflation you want. But unlike a valve, this is a very complex and dynamic problem. You can try to estimate how much wealth will increase, but you will never estimate exactly. You also can't simply add an exact amount of currency in the economy, you need to add it indirectly (too complicated to explain here). So even if you wanted to stay at 0% inflation, that would just be impossible. So usually countries try to target about 2% inflation. That way with natural variation you should vary between 0 and 4% inflation, which are all relatively healthy level of inflation. You don't want to go into deflation long term or too high of an inflation. The other advantage of targeting 2% is that a little bit of inflation is actually good. It incentivize people to invest their money instead of keeping it. Money invested is money that do work and that's good for economic growth. So no it would be physically impossible to keep your inflation at 0%, but even if it was possible that wouldn't be good for economic growth.	Inflation refers to the gradual increase in the prices of goods and services over time, which results in a decrease in the purchasing power of money. In most successful economies, some level of inflation is considered normal and even desirable. However, the question of whether inflation is inevitable in all successful economies is complex and depends on several factors. First, let's understand why inflation occurs. One of the primary reasons is the growth of the money supply. When governments or central banks create more money, there is more money chasing a limited amount of goods and services, which can drive up prices. Additionally, inflation can be driven by increased demand for goods and services, rising production costs, or external factors, such as changes in exchange rates or global economic conditions. Now, returning to the question of the inevitability of inflation, it is important to understand the concept of the inflation target. Most modern central banks aim for a low, stable rate of inflation—usually around 2%—as this is seen as promoting price stability, encouraging spending, and fostering economic growth. Therefore, even in successful economies, some inflation is not only expected but also actively managed and maintained. As for whether there has ever been a society that maintained 0% inflation for a long term while still maintaining a good quality of life, the answer is not entirely clear. Economic data from ancient societies is generally scarce or nonexistent, making it difficult to determine their inflation rates or living standards with precision. Furthermore, the concept of a 0% inflation target is a relatively modern one, and it is not clear that such an idea would have been understood or pursued by ancient societies. That being said, there have been periods of low or negligible inflation in more recent history. For instance, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries adhered to the gold standard—a system in which currencies were backed by a specific amount of gold. During this period, inflation rates were generally quite low, as the money supply was tied to the amount of gold held in reserves. However, the gold standard also had its limitations and was eventually abandoned by most countries in the 20th century. In conclusion, while achieving long-term 0% inflation may not be considered an explicit goal of successful economies, some level of price stability is desirable. Modern central banks usually aim for low, stable inflation rates to foster economic growth and maintain a good quality of life. As for historical examples of societies that maintained low or zero inflation, data is scarce and often inconclusive. However, it's essential to recognize that maintaining a low inflation rate is considered a part of a healthy and successful economy.

The US healthcare system's issues mainly stem from it being a hybrid of private and public institutions, leading to inefficiencies, high costs, and limited access to healthcare for some people. One key factor is the dominance of private insurance companies. Since these companies are profit-driven, they have an incentive to prioritize their earnings over providing affordable healthcare. This can lead to high insurance premiums and deductibles, pricing many people out of comprehensive coverage. Another issue comes from the unequal distribution of healthcare resources. The US spends a lot more on healthcare than other developed countries, yet its outcomes are not much better. This is because the focus is often on expensive medical technologies, rather than on prevention and primary care services. Additionally, the US does not have a single-payer system (like many other countries). This means there's no public organization negotiating with providers for lower prices. As a result, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies can charge much higher prices. The lack of price regulation contributes to the high costs of medical care and medications in the US. Finally, the fragmented nature of the system makes it difficult for people to navigate and understand their options, creating confusion and inefficiencies. Overall, these factors contribute to the problems with the US health insurance system.	More or less a private health insurance industry was built up out of the efforts of individual hospitals and private hospital associations like the American hospital association and other groups to develop payment structures for care in the first half of the 20th century. The US government never engaged in rate setting or any other policy aimed at managing the amounts hospitals could charge*. Public payers with the heft and and incentive to bring down costs while maintaining low prices for members were only developed for the old, disabled, and very poor. Private insurance and provider markets became extremely concentrated and there was basically no anti-trust reaction. In short, the government didn't do any of the several key things other governments do to contain healthcare costs. Every attempt to do so is, generally, met with violent screeching by the republican party and determined opposition by providers and payers. *i just want to note that, as a health policy researcher, it's kind of bs just how little providers get blamed for astronomical prices.

I‘m just sobbing over year old limited vinyl only releases going for x times the original price second hand. Wouldn‘t the artist themself make more money if I could still buy it digitally? Same thing for sneakers etc.	"An artificially limited supply creates a sense of scarcity and exclusivity, which can increase demand and perceived value of a product. When buyers know that only a few people can own the item, such as limited vinyl releases or sneakers, they are often willing to pay higher prices to get their hands on them. This strategy can boost the product's brand image and create hype around it. However, it's a balance, as producing more items may bring in higher sales and revenue, but could dilute the ""exclusive"" appeal.

If the debt ceiling is basically available credit, does the government need to pay this before requesting more credit? Why or why not?	No, America doesn't need to pay off its debt before raising the available credit. Raising the debt ceiling allows the government to borrow more money to cover its expenses, just like a credit card limit increase. As long as the government can continue making interest payments and investors have confidence in lending, it can keep borrowing more without fully paying off its existing debt.	No. The debt ceiling is a completely arbitrary limit placed by congress. Congress can raise it at any time. It has nothing to do with the credit actually available. People are more than willing to continue lending to the government at a rate of 4. 65% at the time of writing, considerably lower than just about anyone else can get.

Rent increases can be primarily attributed to supply and demand, cost of living, and inflation. Understanding these factors helps explain why rents might continually rise, even if it seems like people would eventually stop living in an area due to high costs. First, let's talk about supply and demand. In certain popular cities, there are limited vacant housing units and an increasing number of people looking for places to live. High demand and low supply often lead to increased rent prices, as landlords can charge more for their properties. This could be compared to bidding for a rare item on an auction site - when many people want the same thing, the price tends to go up. Next, the cost of living is a crucial factor. As the overall expenses of daily life increase, landlords need to charge higher rents to cover their own expenses. For example, if property taxes or maintenance costs rise, a landlord may pass these increases onto their tenants in the form of higher rent. Lastly, inflation plays a role in rent hikes. Over time, the value of money decreases, causing the prices of goods and services to increase. Rent is no exception to this rule. Despite rising rents, people may continue living in an area for several reasons. These reasons can include job opportunities, personal ties, or preferences for cultural amenities or weather. In some cases, people simply can't afford to move or find alternative housing options that are significantly more affordable.	Supply and demand. Sure, you could end your lease, but where will you go? If there are lots of rental properties to choose from for a small number of renters, then landlords will have to compete for tenants. That means setting a competitive price. But if there are few rental properties and many people looking for a place to rent, then landlords don't need to compete. They can set a high price, and if you can't afford it, then they'll just rent the place to someone else. In short, rent prices go up when (rental) housing is scarce. They'll (generally) only go down when more housing becomes available. With housing you also have to factor in that it's a very basic need. If the price of jewelry goes up, people can just buy less jewelry. If you can no longer afford to pay your TV subscription, you can cancel it. With many goods and services, not buying them is a perfectly viable option. With housing, this isn't the case. At best, you could stay with other people for a time, but that's only a short-term solution (usually). People need housing and thus they are willing to pay quite a lot for it.

I remember learning about bartering in some elementary school, but it didn’t occur to me to ask until now. How the heck does a society collectively agree that “mm yes these metal circles equate to cows”? Does the government just give everyone 100 shmeckles and let supply and demand cover the rest?	A society transitions from a bartering system to a centralized currency through a gradual process driven by the need for a more efficient and reliable means of exchange. Initially, people might use a widely accepted commodity like salt, shells, or metal for exchanges instead of direct bartering. Eventually, some authority, such as a government or bank, standardizes and regulates these tokens of value by minting coins or issuing paper money. This institution guarantees the currency's value and acceptance in exchange for goods and services. People in the society begin to trust the currency and gradually adopt it, making transactions easier and more efficient than bartering.	There never was a society with a bartering system. We haven't been able to find any evidence of a society which used bartering instead of money. Instead, smaller scale societies which hadn't yet devised some medium of exchange used a system of reciprocal gifting. So I give you 10 spears, now you owe me. Later on, I need a cow, so you give me your spare cow. We all know that a cow is worth more than 10 spears, so now I owe you. I hold a big feast and invite your family, and now we're even. Then you need some arrowheads, so I give you some. And so on.

Starting a microchip company is a complex and expensive process, as it requires massive initial investments, advanced technology, and expertise. The manufacturing process, called semiconductor fabrication, is highly intricate and time-consuming. Additionally, established companies like intel and tsmc have years of research, development, and patents behind their products, making it difficult for newcomers to compete. It would take a new company several years and billions of dollars to build a competitive manufacturing facility and develop viable products, which might not be as profitable or efficient once the shortage is over.	The problem is that it can take years and years to get a factory set up, and you have to find a lot of extremely high-end talent to run the place for you. Then you need to worry about sourcing all of the materials, figuring out what sorts of chips you are going to make, and market them. None of this is easy, which is why they don't just spring up. Your turnaround, and especially looking for a profit is something that you measure in decades.

Eg., Google lost $100B after its AI made a factual error in a demo.	When a publicly traded company loses billions of dollars in one day, it typically refers to a decrease in the company's market value or stock price, not an actual loss of cash. The market value is determined by multiplying the stock price by the number of outstanding shares. Factors such as negative news, poor financial results, or industry trends can cause investors to sell their shares, leading to a drop in the stock price and a decreased market value. For example, if Google's artificial intelligence (ai) made a factual error during a demo causing investors to question the technology's reliability, they might sell their shares. This would cause the stock price to drop and the company's market value to decline, even though there is no direct loss of money. The immediate impact of the loss in market value might not require layoffs or project cancellations within the company, especially if it is a temporary reaction to an isolated event. However, if the decline in market value persists or worsens, it may affect the company's ability to raise funds through issuing new shares, securing loans, or investing in new projects. Over time, a sustained decrease in market value could impact company operations or workforce. Nevertheless, companies can continue to exist even after a significant market value loss, as long as they maintain profitability, adapt to market changes, and win back investor confidence.	"Stock price is just based on what people _think_ the present value of all future earnings of the company are. Since future earnings are just guesses (based on data, but guesses none the less) if one of the key inputs to how that guess is made changes, people will change what they feel each share of stock is worth. The money doesn't ""go"" anywhere because it never existed in the first place. It was just a valuation, which isn't the same thing as actual cash. It would be like if you suddenly found a missing van gogh in your attic - you are suddenly ""richer"" but until you actually _sell_ it, that wealth increase is just on paper. If that painting burns up in a fire, you ""lose"" all of that wealth, but again the actual cash you have doesn't change one penny. How companies react will vary depending on what the news is. Shareholders - who are the owners of the company - want the stock price high, so management will usually make changes to try and show the market that their revenues will go back up in the future."

"The value of a currency does not determine its strength. Currency strength is actually a measure of its stability and purchasing power. 1 aud may be worth more than 1 jpy, but this doesn't make it stronger. It's simply a different unit of measurement, partly due to historical reasons. To compare currency strength, economists look at indicators like interest rates, inflation, economic growth, and trade balances. The Japanese yen is often seen as stronger because it has lower inflation, low interest rates, and an overall stable economy. Japan is also a big exporter, earning a lot of foreign currency, which strengthens its position. Think of it like comparing weight in pounds and kilograms. 1 kilogram is more than 1 pound, but that doesn't mean kilograms are ""stronger. "" they're just different units to measure the same thing."	The value of individual units of a currency are basically irrelevant when considering the strength of a currency. Suppose for example we took the USD and multiplied everything by 10, adding a zero on the end of every price. The average income goes from $31,133 to $311,330 but every price increases as well, so an $8 mcmeal becomes an $80 mcmeal. What really changes? Nothing really, all the numbers work out the same in relative value and the amount of real wealth in existence doesn't change. However instead of 1 AUD being worth 0.67 USD it would now be worth 6.70 USD. That doesn't imply anything about the strength of the currency! Instead the strength of a currency comes from things like overall stability and interest rates.

"In simple terms, when interest rates increase, it becomes more expensive to borrow money. This directly affects the housing market because most people rely on mortgages, which are loans used to buy homes. Higher interest rates mean that the monthly mortgage payments will be higher for the same amount of money borrowed. Consequently, people might not be able to afford the same house they could if the interest rates were lower. This can result in reduced demand for homes, causing the housing market to slow down. Furthermore, existing homeowners might have a harder time selling their homes, as potential buyers might be unable to afford the higher mortgage payments. So, when your coworker said ""the house market is messed up because they keep raising interest rates"", they meant that the increasing cost of borrowing money is negatively impacting the housing market."	So, houses are pretty expensive. This means that people nearly always have to borrow lots of money to buy them. If people need to borrow lots of money to buy houses, then the price of houses is very responsive to how cheap it is to borrow money. To combat inflation, central banks are raising interest rates*. This has the effect of making loans more expensive. Much more expensive borrowing has led to demand for houses to dry up very, very fast and will, in all likelihood, lead to price declines in the housing sector. *technically, they raise an interest rate for interbank borrowing that has nothing directly to do with mortgages, but it causes money to become pricier to borrow, overall, and thus affects interest rates for all lending.
133	f494c617-6b0a-4790-af04-3ce02d639093.txt	Why are wages not keeping up with cost of living?	In simple terms, wages not keeping up with the cost of living means that people's earnings are not increasing at the same rate as the prices of goods and services they need to buy, making it harder for them to afford their basic needs and maintain their standard of living. This issue can be attributed to three main factors: inflation, stagnation in wage growth, and the influence of market forces. First, let's talk about inflation. Inflation is the gradual increase in the prices of goods and services over time, which affects the purchasing power of money. This means that as prices go up, the same amount of money buys less than it did before. For wages to keep up with the cost of living, they need to increase at the same rate as inflation. If wages don't rise at the same pace, people's purchasing power decreases, and it becomes harder to afford basic necessities. Secondly, wage growth stagnation plays a significant role. Due to various factors such as increased job automation, reduced union power, and global competition, wages for many workers haven't been growing at the same rate as in the past. This means that even if prices increase due to inflation, wages may not rise accordingly, which contributes to the growing gap between earnings and living expenses. Finally, market forces can also affect the relationship between wages and the cost of living. In some industries, there may be an oversupply of labor, which means there are more workers than job openings. In this situation, employers have the upper hand and can offer lower wages since there are plenty of people willing to take the job. Conversely, in industries with a high demand for labor but a shortage of workers, employers may need to raise wages to attract qualified candidates. These wage imbalances between different industries can contribute to the overall issue of wages not keeping up with the cost of living. To sum up, when wages don't keep up with the cost of living, it's usually due to a combination of inflation, wage growth stagnation, and market forces. This can lead to a decrease in people's purchasing power and make it challenging for them to maintain their current standard of living.	"Tldr: government inaction and lobbying by big business businesses have a vested interest in keeping the cost of labor down, because the workers are often the most expensive part of running a business. So even as the cost of living increases, the average wage tends to remain stagnant. Minimum wage laws were passed originally to force companies to pay people a living wage, meaning that every employee was making enough money to makes ends meet. But with inflation the cost of living increases, so the minimum wage has to be increased to compensate. This idea in the public consciousness that minimum wage jobs are 'starter jobs for young people' is totally wrong and not in the spirit of the laws. This comes from decades of lobbying from big businesses to convince people of this. The average age of a person on minimum wage in the US is 35. Other average wages are tied to the minimum wage, because the average worker is often thought of as working x dollars over minimum. So as the minimum wage goes up so do other salaries in the lower brackets. This is why the old argument of ""i work x trade job, if burger flippers get a minimum wage increase and make y dollars an hour that's unfair because that's more than I make"" is asinine, because a minimum wage increase affects salaries all over the pay scale. So why is the minimum wage so low? Decades of lobbying have kept the minimum wage low to benefit companies and protect corporate profits. Now it's so low that increasing it too fast to what it should be will be a disaster and cause rampant inflation. So it has to be increased steadily over a period of time."

And how do you know the percentage of a company you own?	If they create new stock, then generally you are diluted (your existing stock is worth a smaller percentage of the company). This isn't always bad if the new investment increases the capitalization of the company then it is possible that you actually make money (even if each share is worth less). Public companies publish reports saying how many stocks are issued. You know how many sticks you own. Divide your stocks by the number of shares outstanding and multiply by 100% to get your percentage of the company. Unless you are very wealthy I can almost guarantee you the answer is 0%. For example, let's say you had 1000 shares of aapl (apple). This is worth about $160,000 today (3/20/2023). Aapl had 15,892,723,000 outstanding shares at the end of 2022. This means you'd own:(1000 / 15892723000) \* 100% = 0. 00000629218% \~= 0% of the company. It is possible to own a considerably larger percentage of a private company (many early employees at startups own significant stakes (which will get diluted over time as the company takes on investors). You can ask the finance department of the company how many shares are outstanding, but they may not tell you.	When you buy a stock, you are essentially purchasing a small piece of ownership in that company. If the company releases more stocks, it is issuing additional shares of ownership, which can result in a decrease in the percentage of the company you own, but not the number of your shares. This process is called stock dilution. Imagine a company is like a pizza, and each stock is a slice. If the pizza has 10 slices and you own one of them, you own 10% of the pizza. Now, if the pizza is cut into 20 slices instead, with you still owning one slice, your ownership is now only 5% of the pizza. Even though your slice hasn't changed, the proportion of the pizza that you own has. To figure out the percentage of a company you own, you first need to know the total number of shares issued by the company. This information can often be found on financial statements and stock market websites. Then, simply divide the number of shares you own by the total number of shares issued and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company and there are 10,000 shares issued, your ownership percentage would be (100/10,000) x 100 = 1%.

Social security is not a savings or investment account. Those dollars you pay in now go to take care of the people collecting now. Think of it this way, when they enacted it the people who were 65 at the time got benefits immediately. That money came from contributors at that time. Short answer, that money you have been putting in is already gone.	If the social security program were terminated, the money already paid into the system would likely be used to pay out remaining benefits to current and near-future recipients. How the funds would be distributed depends on the specific legislation ending the program. There's no guarantee that individual contributors would receive a refund of their contributions, as the system is designed as a pooled fund to support all beneficiaries.

"The valuation of large corporations is based on their perceived value and future potential, rather than just the actual money invested by investors. This concept is called market capitalization, or ""market cap"" for short. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of shares a company has issued by the current price of each share. For example, if a company issues 1 million shares and each share is worth $100, the market cap is $100 million. The share price is determined by various factors such as the company's earnings, future growth prospects, overall market sentiment, and more. It's important to differentiate between the market cap and actual invested money. The money investors put into a company, either through buying shares or by directly investing in the company (venture capital, for instance), represents a fraction of the total market cap. Most of the market cap is actually based on the perceived value of the company in the market. Think of it like this: imagine you bought a collectible toy for $10, and over time its value increased to $100. The initial investment was $10, but the perceived value of the toy is now $100. The same principle applies to the valuation of large corporations. As the perceived value of the company rises, the market cap increases, even though the amount of real money invested hasn't changed significantly. In conclusion, the valuation of large corporations is mostly based on the perceived value of the company and its future potential, rather than just the actual money invested by investors. This can give the impression of ""imaginary money,"" but it reflects the market's expectations for the company's growth and success."	Imagine you start a small business, your and your family and friends friends chip in 10,000 between you to get started, this is your seed capital. Your business is making widgets and you can make 100/day, they cost 6 to make in materials, sell for 20 each, your margin is 14. Of the 1400 margin each day, your business overheads are 1000, leaving 400 net profit. Production runs 5 days a week, 45 weeks a year to allow for maintenance, that's 225 days/year, so in theory 90,000 net profit per annum. In the first year you pay back the seed capital with interest, leaving you with 75k. How do you value this business? It's clearly worth far more than the seed capital. Once you've been trading for a year, if you can show there's sufficient demand, the business has to be worth multiple year's profits. . So 180k? 270k? Maybe even 450k? In due course you might invest in doubling production capacity, hopefully overheads don't double, so the profit margins increase, maybe the annual net becomes 200k. Your business is now worth 600k or more. But a competitor might put pressure on prices, reducing profits, and reducing the value of the business. All these factors come into play. The stock price of apple or tesla is a complex mix of past history and future expectations, with rumour and hype and nay-saying thrown in.

It is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay for it. This is primarily due to the fact that paintings don't often have comparable assets to use to determine objective worth. You can look at what other assets - real estate, cars, etc. - sell for to other buyers because we assume that similar assets will sell for similar prices, but for items that are one of a kind (like paintings) establishing comparable sales is next to impossible. This makes it very easy to use paintings to make illegitimate transfers of money look legitimate. So, for example, lets say I want to pay you a bribe of $1m. I can't just hand you the cash - that would be illegal. I can, however, have you buy a painting for $1m and then sell it to me for $2m. That looks like a legitimate art sale, but it's actually a bribe. I could also do it in reverse - sell you a $2m painting for $1m. When you sell it later for $2m, the bribe is paid to you despite you actually giving me money. Similarly, it can be used to launder money effectively. If I can get my ill-gotten gains out of the country and into a friendly bank in the caymans, I can have a shell corporation I control buy art from my personal collection at inflated prices, making my ill-gotten money look like legitimate art sale profits. Tax write-offs are a bit more complex, but use the same principle about value. If I buy a painting for $1m, have it appraised at $2m and then donate it to a museum, I can claim a $2m charitable deduction on my taxes (charitable deductions for property are done at fair market value, which my appraisal establishes) - despite the painting only ""really"" costing me $1m. The _really_ fun part is that the more I do any of the above, the less like money laundering/bribes/tax evasion it actually looks like! If I start selling an artist's work at inflated prices, those prices start to become the fair market value of that artist's work, and the inflated sale prices look more like what it should _legitimatly_ sell for. The more I launder, the less likely I am to get caught laundering! They are also _very_ good for smugging money out of a country since paintings are very small. You can buy one for millions, roll it up in a tube, take it on a plane anywhere in the world, then sell it overseas - effectively moving millions of dollars in wealth in a single carry on bag."	"Paintings can be used as bribes, tax write-offs, and money laundering tools due to their often high value, difficulty to trace, subjective pricing, and the unregulated nature of the art market. To understand how paintings can be used in these ways, let's first break down each concept. 1. Bribes: a bribe is something valuable given to someone, usually in a position of power, in exchange for a favor, influence, or special treatment. Paintings, particularly those by famous artists, can be incredibly valuable, sometimes fetching millions of dollars at auction. Since it's relatively easy to transport and store a painting, they can be given as bribes to sway someone's decision or to gain their support. A high-value painting might, for example, be gifted to an influential politician or businessperson in exchange for their political support or favorable contracts. 2. Tax write-offs: a tax write-off, or tax deduction, refers to an expense that can be subtracted from an individual or business's taxable income, which ultimately reduces the amount of tax paid. In the context of paintings, they can be used as tax write-offs when donated to qualifying non-profit institutions like museums, galleries, or schools. When someone donates a high-value painting, they may be eligible to deduct the fair market value of the painting from their taxable income, potentially saving them a significant amount in taxes. This encourages wealthy individuals to support art and culture through their donations while benefiting from the tax advantage. 3. Money laundering: money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained money appear legitimate by disguising its true source. In the world of art, paintings can be used to launder money in several ways. Here are two common methods:a. Buy and sell: a person wishing to launder illegal funds may purchase a painting using this dirty money. They can then sell this painting to an unwitting buyer who pays them using clean, legitimate money. This exchange makes it appear as if the launderer has earned the money legitimately by selling the painting, effectively turning the illicit funds into ""clean"" money. B. Art swaps: another money laundering technique involves the exchange of two or more expensive paintings. In this case, a criminal might own a high-value painting bought with ""dirty money"" and then find a willing partner to swap it with another expensive painting, effectively disguising the ownership trail of the original artwork. The criminal could then sell the second painting to a legitimate buyer for ""clean"" money. In conclusion, paintings can serve as effective tools in bribes, tax write-offs, and money laundering due to their high and subjective value, portability, and the unregulated nature of the art market. As a result, authorities and art market participants are increasingly seeking greater transparency and regulation within the industry to inhibit these illicit practices."

"The ""right to work"" law is a policy that prevents people from being forced to join a union as a condition of employment. In simple terms, it means that employees can choose whether or not to join or financially support a union at their workplace. In states that don't have right to work laws, employees may be required to join a union and pay fees to retain their job. The main idea behind these laws is to protect employees' freedom of choice and prevent coercion by unions. However, some argue that right to work laws can weaken unions, as they have fewer resources and bargaining power if not everyone contributes financially. Opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of right to work laws vary, but the central concept is about giving employees the option to decide their involvement in unions."	"The ""right to work"" laws should be called the ""right to work without paying union dues"" laws. In many positions where there are unions, there are agreements where everyone in the position pays dues towards the union. Typically, workers not in the union pay less. In effect, non-union workers are paying for benefits that the union previously fought for. Things like not working on the weekend, 40 hour work week, breaks, and sick leave that apply even if you're not in the union. In states with right to work, workers do not need to pay these fees and are not required to join unions for certain positions. The reduction in funds and people in the union weakens union power and strengthens the power of companies over labor."

Can Mr. Joe Shblow, given that he is able to come up with previously mentioned “shit ton of money”, go out and open his own bank? Obviously it takes time, but what’s the process of doing so?	Starting a bank involves several steps, but it's possible for anyone with enough money and meeting regulatory requirements. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:1. Develop a business plan: outline the type of banking services offered, target customers, and financial projections. This plan will guide the entire process and is crucial when seeking approval from regulatory authorities. 2. Raise capital: banks need a significant amount of money to cover operational costs, loans, and meet regulatory requirements. This money can be raised through personal savings, investments, or borrowing from other financial institutions. 3. Obtain appropriate licenses: in most countries, you need to obtain a banking license from financial regulatory authorities. This may involve meeting capital requirements, proving management competence, and providing a clear plan for operations. 4. Set up operations: once licensed, set up the bank's physical location, hire staff, and implement systems to manage transactions, loans, and customer accounts. 5. Market and acquire customers: promote your bank to attract customers and begin offering banking services, such as deposit accounts, loans, and other financial products. Overall, starting a	1.

You then fill out several applications that will require more back-up paperwork than will fit in a small truck. This application goes to the federal reserve, who will go over it with a fine-toothed comb because they don't just let anyone have a bank, because otherwise rich bad people would do bad rich people things with it. 4. Anywhere from 18 months to 10 years later, you may be approved to open a new bank.

How have companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock or Nestle, Pepsi, Coke, grown to be as big as they are with these 2 acts in place. It should prohibit them from growing to these sizes but they only seem to be getting bigger.	The sherman antitrust act of 1890 and the clayton antitrust act of 1914 were designed to prevent monopolies and protect competition in the market. The reason they may seem ineffective against modern companies like vanguard, blackrock, nestle, pepsi, and coke is that these businesses have grown through legal means, avoiding anti-competitive practices that the acts target. These companies strategically use mergers and acquisitions to expand while maintaining compliance with regulations. Additionally, as the global economy has evolved, it's become harder to apply the antiquated laws to modern business practices. Furthermore, interpretation and enforcement of these acts can greatly depend on government priorities and agency resources, allowing some large companies to continue growing without facing significant antitrust challenges.	Since the 70’s or so, antitrust has been interpreted from the perspective of harm vs. Benefit to the consumer. As long as a merger is supposedly of benefit to the consumer, it is permitted. Benefit, in this case, generally just means lower prices. The evidence required to show that prices would be lower is pretty minimal, and after the merger is approved there is no actual enforcement requiring prices to actually go down. This is exacerbated by government enforcement agencies not being provided enough resources to effectively argue against corporate claims of consumer benefits in court. As long as corporations go through a pro forma ritual of saying they are acting for the benefit of the consumer, they can do what they want.

Large companies like doordash and uber continue to function despite negative revenues because investors believe in their long-term potential. These companies focus on growing their customer base and expanding their services, which often requires significant upfront costs. Investors provide funding, hoping that once these companies achieve a dominant market position, they'll eventually become profitable. It's a calculated risk, where short-term losses are accepted in pursuit of long-term gains.	"Generally a lot of venture capital money - they're in businesses that people see as disruptive and likely to become profitable later, so they put heaps of money in to scale them up and effectively gain a monopoly on the market. I would highly recommend a video by patrick boyle (a finance professor and quantitative trader) on Youtube called ""blitzscaling"" that is all about this business tactic. Very helpful and quite funny."

Does it have to do with infrastructure? Thanks. [http://nhenergy.blogspot.com/2014_01_01_archive. Html? M=1](http://nhenergy.blogspot.com/2014_01_01_archive. Html? M=1)	New england states rely on home heating oil primarily due to historical reasons and infrastructure limitations. When these states modernized their heating systems in the early-to-mid 1900s, natural gas wasn't readily available, so they chose oil-based systems. As natural gas became more popular in other parts of the country, new england's infrastructure wasn't easily adaptable to switch from oil-based systems to natural gas. Thus, they continued using home heating oil, which remains the case today, despite being more expensive and less environmentally friendly than other heating options.	Following world war ii, the northeast had some decent infrastructure and terminals for crude oil as the fuel was used for shipping and wartime effort from northeast shipyards. After the war, england owed the US a significant amount of money for our supplies, materials and support in the war. Brent sea crude was plentiful, possessed by England and easily transported to the Northeast US. Many homes in the northeast were ready to be upgraded from wood and coal to a better (at the time) fuel source. Win - win for everyone.
144	9bcdad96-5606-4bd6-942f-f62f3848afe4.txt	If people all decide to remove their money from a bank at the same time, does it have a serious economic impact? I ask because since our money is backed in value (a precious resource like gold and oil) and doesn’t leave the country, doesn’t it also mean that our wealth remains intact as a nation regardless of whether or not the bank has it? (ie, US citizens have it, so it doesn’t matter if it’s in a bank or not- the wealth is held by a US Citizen).	"Yes, if people all decide to remove their money from a bank at the same time, it can have a serious economic impact. This phenomenon is called a ""bank run. "" it's important to understand that banks operate on a system called fractional reserve banking, where they only hold a fraction of the deposits as reserves and loan out the rest to generate profits. When many people withdraw their money simultaneously, banks may not have enough liquid assets (cash) to fulfill all the withdrawal requests. To meet the demands, they may be forced to sell other assets like loans or investments, which could be sold at a loss, affecting the bank's financial stability. This can cause a domino effect on other banks and the larger economy, leading to a financial crisis. Although it's true that the wealth remains in the country, the issue is the confidence in the banking system. If people lose faith in banks' ability to safeguard their money, it can lead to a situation where everyone starts to hoard cash, spend less, and reduce their economic activity, slowing down the economy. Additionally, banks play a crucial role in facilitating lending and borrowing, which is essential for economic growth. If banks face a crisis, they may reduce lending or even collapse, leading to credit crunches, business closures, and increased unemployment. In summary, when people remove their money from banks all at once, it can potentially destabilize the banking system and the entire economy, even if the wealth remains in the country through citizens' holdings. The reduced confidence and disruption of financial services can lead to significant negative consequences."	First, your money is not backed by anything other than the confidence that you and everyone else can use that money to purchase goods and services or to make investments. There's literally nothing else backing that money. You can't trade it in for a set amount of gold or oil. Except if you want to buy gold or oil, and even then the price of gold and oil fluctuates based upon whether people want to buy gold or oil. So the more people who want to buy gold or oil, the more money you're going to have to spend to get the same amount of gold and oil you could have gotten before demand went up. Second, if everyone sought to withdraw their money from banks at the same time, there would be disastrous economic consequences. Simply put, the banks do not have all the money on deposit available to disperse. They have some smaller amount, called a reserve, on hand to distribute. What you describe is a run on a bank (where many depositors seek to withdraw all their money at once), and a run on a bank is disastrous for that bank. It will almost certainly cause the bank to fail. If that happened simultaneously at many banks or all the banks, economies would collapse since people would both not have all their money, and not have any confidence in the money they do have.

How can, say, a top executive, even the CEO be allowed to purchase their own company's stock when they most likely have knowledge of the company's overall performance, etc and it not be considered insider trading? I assume they would have insight into company announcements, financials, etc that, when released to the public, could cause the stock price to rise (or vice versa, fall) - how are they allowed to buy/sell stock at all?	"In a nutshell, executives and insiders can buy and sell their own company's stock, but they must follow strict rules and regulations to prevent insider trading. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a company's stocks or securities using non-public, material information that can influence the stock price. This gives insiders an unfair advantage over ordinary investors and undermines trust in the financial markets. To prevent this, there are rules and regulations governing when and how insiders can trade their company's stock. Firstly, insiders must report all their trades to the u. S. Securities and exchange commission (sec) within a specified time frame, usually two business days. This ensures that their trades are disclosed to the public, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on the insider's actions. This also helps the sec monitor and detect any potential insider trading. Secondly, insiders must abide by specific trading schedules or ""trading windows. "" these are periods during which they are allowed to buy or sell their company's stock. These windows typically open after the announcement of quarterly earnings or other significant financial reports, when the material information is already public. This helps to level the playing field, as insiders will not have access to non-public information that could influence their trading decisions during these periods. Thirdly, insiders can use something called a ""10b5-1 plan"" to trade their company's stock without violating insider trading laws. A 10b5-1 plan is a pre-determined trading plan that outlines when and how much stock the insider plans to buy or sell. This plan must be established when the insider does not have any material non-public information and must be followed strictly. By committing to a trading plan in advance, the insider demonstrates that their trades are not based on non-public information, and thus avoids any accusations of insider trading. Additionally, some companies implement ""blackout periods"" around major announcements, during which employees and insiders are prohibited from trading company stocks. This further reduces the risk of insider trading by limiting the window in which an insider can take advantage of non-public information. In conclusion, while company executives and insiders have access to sensitive information, they are allowed to buy and sell their company's stock as long as they follow strict rules and regulations to ensure a level playing field for all investors. These rules include timely reporting of trades, adhering to trading windows, using pre-determined 10b5-1 plans, and observing company-imposed blackout periods."	"It's not automatically insider trading for a person involved with a company to trade in its stock. This law has a lot of subjective leeway. But it is true that it is harder for people in these positions to trade stock in their company without risk. Oversimplified, you break the law if you have information that is not yet public that would likely affect other traders' opinions of whether to buy or sell stock. But it's sort of time-sensitive and it's easier to get in trouble for short-term decisions than long-term ones. So a CEO who sells their stock immediately before a bad quarterly earnings report? They'll likely get in trouble. A bad earnings report usually motivates people to sell. However, even if they sell 10 seconds after that report goes public, that is fine because now the information is public. What if the CEO knows that next year a super-secret project is going to release and starts buying in advance? This falls much more on the subjective side of the law. It's harder to argue that if it were known a super-secret project will happen next year that investors in general would invest in the stock *today*. And there are still chances that between today and next year, things happen that cause the project to be canceled. So this scenario is much more grey area. So people have a lot of strategies to avoid this. One is to announce projects to reduce how much ""secret"" knowledge you're leaning on. Another is to buy and sell large amounts of stock on a schedule, so you can argue you're following a pattern and not basing the decision on product announcements. A problem with it being so subjective is it can look like a lot of times rich people get away with something that less rich people might get busted for. It's a different discussion entirely, but it's more likely that very rich people will employ lawyers and accountants who work together to assess their risk of insider trading charges whereas less wealthy people are more likely to go on their own thoughts."

Argentina has 100% inflation mainly due to a combination of economic problems, such as a persistent budget deficit, high public debt, and a dependence on printing money. Inflation occurs when there's a general rise in the prices of goods and services in an economy, which then leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of its currency. One of the main reasons behind Argentina's inflation is the government's budget deficit. When the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it has to find ways to finance this difference. One way is to borrow money by issuing bonds, but when lenders become reluctant to buy them, the government might resort to printing more money. This increases the total amount of money circulating in the economy, which in turn pushes up prices and creates inflation. Besides, Argentina has a high level of public debt, and its government has defaulted on its debts multiple times throughout history. This leads to a lack of trust from international investors, who may demand higher interest rates before lending, making it even more difficult for the country to borrow and repay its debts. Another factor contributing to Argentina's inflation is its dependence on exporting commodities, such as soybeans and beef, for its revenue. Fluctuations in the prices of these commodities, due to changing global demand, can significantly impact Argentina's economy. When commodity prices are low or the demand declines, Argentina may face a reduction in revenue, causing the government to resort back to printing more money and further fueling inflation. In summary, Argentina's 100% inflation can be attributed to a mixture of budget deficit, high public debt, and reliance on printing money, all of which work together to erode the value of	"Inflation is always a monetary process. Basically the sum of the following: \- money printing machine turned up to 11 by a populist socialist government in order to keep subsidies and crazy expending in place\- Argentina is one the most economically repressed countries of the ""civilized/western"" countries. Its easier to open a candy store in the middle of the fifth avenue in new york than in buenos aires. Bureaucracy, high taxes, prices control, foreign currency exchange control and government intervention has basically deteriorated the expectative of organic economic growth in the country. Therefore their money is seen as a downtrend asset, so people in Argentina flee to another currencies in order to hedge against inflation. US dollar, euro, chilean peso or bitcoin weakening even further the argentinian peso. \- Argentina is know by it's rampant corruption and mismanagement of the country reserves. They have defaulted on their debt 12 times in a row. So nobody from the international investment community wants to touch Argentina. The country risk of Argentina is greater than Ukraine. This makes foreign currency even more scarce, driving upwards their price against ars. The US dollar on the black market is like 3x more than the ""official government defined exchange rate"" \- and as last: there is a very low expectation that this context will change in the near future"

If you're paying insurance, why do you still get charged an often large part of your medical expenses when you have an accident?"	A deductible is the amount you pay for medical expenses before your insurance starts covering the costs. It's a way to share the financial risk between you and the insurance company. The purpose of having a deductible is to reduce the insurance premium, as higher deductibles generally result in lower premiums. This encourages responsible usage of healthcare services and helps prevent overuse or unnecessary treatments.

So, a sum like ""3 pounds, 5 shillings, and 6 pence"" would be written as ""£3/5/6.

149	502f28b8-49f8-4bda-8ae0-d0fe267b3f6f.txt	Why is it so hard to overturn ticketmaster's monopoly?	Ticketmaster's monopoly is difficult to overturn due to a combination of factors including network effects, exclusive contracts, and strong relationships with key industry players. To start, network effects play a significant role. In the ticketing industry, a larger user base means more events and more tickets sold, making the platform more attractive to both event organizers and ticket buyers. As the dominant force in the industry, ticketmaster already has a large and established user base, which in turn attracts new users, further reinforcing their dominant position. This creates a barrier to entry for competitors, as they struggle to match the same levels of user adoption. Additionally, ticketmaster has signed exclusive contracts with many venues and event organizers, further consolidating its control. These deals grant ticketmaster exclusive rights to sell tickets for particular venues or events, making it difficult for rivals to enter the market and compete for the same events. Finally, relationships with key industry players, such as music and sports promoters, also contribute to ticketmaster's stronghold. These relationships have been built over decades and work in ticketmaster's favor, making it hard for newcomers to disrupt the market. In summary, the combination of network effects, exclusive contracts, and strong industry relationships makes it challenging to overturn ticketmaster's monopoly in the ticketing market.	"What ticketmaster is doing is using their near -monopoly in one area to get a competitive advantage in another area. In many countries this would be considered an ""unfair"" advantage, particularly in the EU. Ticketmaster's parent company owns a huge number of concert venues. If a band wants to play in one of those venues they must use ticketmaster to sell their tickets. Using a monopoly in one industry to gain a monopoly in another. As to why it's so hard to overturn, it's mostly because the political will just is not there. The merger of ticketmaster with live nation should never have happened, and it could have been prevented by the competition/anti-trust authorities. Lots of monopolies have been broken up in the past in the US, most famously standard oil and at&t. Perhaps the obvious solution is to simply have the venue owning part of the company spun off from the ticket selling part. Without owning venues, ticketmaster has less leverage to force artists to use it's ticket selling service, and competitors will be able to enter the market and hopefully drive down fees."
150	d6a12fff-22eb-4b52-bc3f-9f8809eecf2c.txt	Why is US postage the same for 2 miles and 2000 miles?	US postage costs are standardized for all distances because the postal system aims to provide a consistent and accessible service to everyone, no matter where they are located in the country. Postal services have fixed costs like sorting, processing, and handling mail regardless of the distance it travels. Additionally, the mail is transported using a vast and interconnected network, where items often travel in bulk with many other letters and packages. This allows for efficient distribution of costs across the entire system, and it makes the distance a less significant factor in determining price. The government initially set a uniform postage rate to ensure that communication was affordable and fair to everyone, including people living in remote areas. This principle of equal access to mail services is crucial to the functioning of the nation as a whole and helps ensure that vital services like voting, tax documentation, and communication remain accessible to all citizens. In summary, US postage is the same for 2 miles and 2000 miles to ensure everyone has equal access to mail services and to efficiently distribute fixed costs across the entire postal network.	The transit distance isn't the main cost, it's the overall infrastructure of the postal system. Whether or not a single piece of mail gets sent from orlando to miami or from orlando to seattle, the mail truck from orlando to miami and the plane from orlando to seattle are still going to make that trip every day. As are thousands of other vehicles going on routes. That extra mail won't add a fraction of a cent to the operating cost of either vehicle, but in the aggregate they do cause wear on the equipment, and the equipment requires maintenance, and people to operate it, and other expenses that generally get incurred in running the postage system. Where you start to see higher rates are in places where that isn't the case - either a courier service that charters a vehicle to deliver something, large deliveries that require special trips, things like that - that is where you get more expensive delivery fees.

I was looking up the average networth of 30 year olds in the United states and it said: ""the average net worth is $122,000 and the median net worth is $35,112""."	The main difference between median and average is how they represent the central tendency of a dataset. In simple terms, the average (also known as the mean) is calculated by adding together all the values in a dataset and then dividing that sum by the total number of values. The median, on the other hand, is the middle value of the dataset when all values are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. To illustrate this, let's consider an example. Imagine ten 30-year-olds with varying net worths: $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $60,000, and $500,000. The average net worth would be calculated by adding all these values together, which equals $780,000, and then dividing by 10 (the total number of values), resulting in $78,000. The median net worth, however, involves identifying the middle value, which in this case is $35,000, because there are five values smaller and five values larger. In the context of your question, the average net worth ($122,000) might be skewed by a few extremely wealthy individuals, while the median net worth ($35,112) represents the	*median* is one type of average. You put all the sample into order and then the median is at the halfway mark. For income it means half the population earn more and half earn less. *mean* is another type of average - you add all the sample values together and then divide by the number of samples. The number might not be what any individual sample scores. Median is useful for things like income and wealth as it cuts off the outlier values. Eg for income a handful of billionaires can radically skew the result to show a much higher income or wealth than any ordinary person is realistically on. Mean is useful for a lot of statistical analysis, and for some types of average when the distribution of results follows a certain pattern and there are either no outliers or outliers are balanced. There’s another average called “mode” - this is the value that’s most common. Mode is more for things where the samples can’t really be put into order - eg what color is the average car. Median doesn’t work. Mean would be weird. Mode is more useful here.

"In simple terms, banks and exchanges need to pause withdrawals when they face financial trouble to maintain their stability and prevent a situation called a ""bank run. ""a bank run occurs when a large number of people start withdrawing their money from a bank all at once, because they fear the bank might fail or go bankrupt. This can actually cause the bank to fail, since banks don't hold all their customers' deposited money in cash. Instead, they lend a portion of it out to others, with the expectation that the loans will be repaid with interest over time. This is called fractional reserve banking. When a bank or an exchange faces a financial crisis, pausing withdrawals helps them avoid a bank run and buys them time to stabilize their finances. It means they can focus on recovering from the crisis in an orderly way, without having to make rushed decisions driven by panic. The pause also helps protect the customers' money so they don't lose all their savings in case the bank goes bankrupt. In short, banks and exchanges pause withdrawals during a financial crisis to prevent a destructive chain reaction of withdrawals, and to allow themselves time to recover and protect their customers' funds."	If you're a bank, the worst thing that can happen is someone coming up to the counter asking for their money and you not being able to give it to them. That causes your customers (account holders) to lose all confidence in you, and they will all promptly try to withdraw their money in hopes that they can get some of their money out. This is called a bank run or a run on the bank. Side note: most if not all privately held accounts at banks are protected by the fdic, the federal deposit insurance corporation. The fdic protects banks and their customers by guaranteeing each account up to $250,000; if you try to withdraw and the bank is unable to pay you, the fdic will pay out for you instead. So a bank temporarily stopping withdrawals is a way to get ahead of a bank run. The idea is to buy time while the bank tries to get more funds in (from loan payments or other assets), so that they can reopen later, pay out withdrawals, and not run out of money.

Going public means that members of the public can buy stock in your company. That means you can raise money for minimal effort, which is obviously good for a business. It can get you through a rough patch where money is tight, or let you raise money to expand and build a new factory, etc. If you remain private, you have to come up with the money yourself, which isn't always possible. The drawback to going public is that you don't have as much control over your company. The shareholders get a say, and you have to share you profits with them. This may or may not be worth it, depending on your company's specific situation.	Going public is a big deal for companies because it allows them to raise large amounts of capital by selling shares of the company to the public. This capital can be used to expand the business, fund new projects, or repay debts. It also increases the company's visibility and credibility, potentially attracting more customers and business partners. While many private companies are successful, going public can provide a company with resources and benefits that would be difficult to achieve otherwise. However, going public also comes with some downsides, such as increased regulatory scrutiny, higher costs, and more pressure from shareholders to focus on short-term profits rather than long-term growth.

Healthcare costs have not become cheaper due to increased technology and innovation because while advancements can improve care, they often come with a high price tag. Additionally, the aging population requires more complex medical treatments, which also increases cost. Administrative expenses and inefficiencies in the healthcare system contribute to rising costs as well. Furthermore, malpractice lawsuits can lead to higher medical costs as doctors and hospitals must purchase insurance to cover potential legal issues. Despite innovations, these factors combined tend to maintain or increase overall healthcare costs.	In the US? The system is not optimized for cost efficiency. The system, like most systems in capitalism, is optimized to extract value from lower class people and funnel it to upper class people. The wealthy megacorporations that control US healthcare have successfully defeated all attempts to reform the system, because an ad campaign is cheap in comparison to real competition, and they know all the buttons to push to make any reform sound like a loss of freedom as opposed to a creation of rights to access to care.

To me it seems like free money.	A tax return is a yearly financial report that individuals and businesses submit to the government, showing their income, expenses, and taxes paid throughout the year. Essentially, it helps to calculate if you've paid the correct amount of taxes. During the year, a portion of your income is automatically withheld and sent to the government as taxes. But sometimes, the amount that's withheld is more than you actually owe based on your income and eligible deductions (like work-related expenses or educational costs). When this happens, you may receive a tax refund, which is the difference between the taxes you've paid and the amount you owe. So, it's not exactly free money – it’s more like getting back the extra amount you've unintentionally overpaid in taxes throughout the year.	"Tax ""returns"" are just records of the taxes you paid and why. You're probably thinking of tax *refunds*. Most people pay taxes throughout the year by having them automatically taken out of their paychecks (""withholding""). But the amount taken out of your paycheck is just an estimate. It may be too low (in which case you'll owe money, though typically only a small percentage of the taxes you've already paid), or it may be too high (in which case you get money back from the IRS, since you overpaid them). If you work a normal salaried job that gives a w2 (the usual form for most people's income), you would have filled out a form answering some common questions used to estimate how much should be withheld for tax purposes."

Thanks all.	California catalytic converters are more expensive because they have to meet stricter emission regulations set by the California air resources board (carb). California is known for its strong environmental policies and high air pollution, so these regulations are put in place to protect the environment and public health. Carb-certified converters contain a higher amount of precious metals, such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, which are essential for reducing harmful emissions. These metals are costly, making the converters more expensive. Additionally, suppliers need to obtain special certification for their converters to be sold in California, adding further costs. As a result, converters that meet California's requirements come with a higher price tag compared to those sold elsewhere in the United states.	Carb mandated warranties are to blame for the inflated prices. A carb-compliant catalytic converter is one that has been approved for sale by the California air resources board (carb). Carb emission standards for aftermarket catalytic converters are more elaborate than the epa standards for aftermarket catalytic converters and requires a more extensive warranty than the epa. As a result, carb-compliant catalytic converters typically use an enhanced combination of washcoat technology and higher precious metal load to meet the stricter emissions conversions standard. A carb-compliant converter will also have an executive order (eo) number/stamp on its body. The stamped number on the converter body must match the correct eo number listed on the California air resources board website for aftermarket catalytic converters.

Eta thank you everyone for taking the time to respond! I know it seems super obvious as to how it works, this was a late night thought I had and needed to know 😂	Pharmacies keep a stock of commonly prescribed medications on hand. When you provide your prescription, the pharmacist checks their inventory, measures and packages the drug, and puts the proper labeling and instructions on it. If the medication isn't in stock, they can usually order it and have it ready in a short time. Efficient organization and well-trained staff help facilitate the quick turnaround for prescriptions.	General yes, pharmacies will keep enough of the more commonly requested medications in stock so that most prescriptions can be filled the same day. When that's not possible, depending on various factors, many pharmacies may have multiple deliveries from suppliers each week, making it possible to order anything that isn't in stock within a few days if it's available from the supplier.

Says it was the first big bank since 2008 to do so.	Banks fail when they are no longer able to meet their financial obligations, either because they have taken on excessive risk or have encountered unforeseen circumstances that result in significant losses. This can lead to a situation where a bank is unable to return the money to its depositors, pay its debts, or continue its normal operations. There are several reasons that can lead to a bank's failure:1. Bad loans: banks lend money to borrowers, expecting them to repay the loans with interest. If too many borrowers fail to repay their loans, the bank can face losses too large to recover from. 2. Poor investments: banks can invest in various assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate. If those investments perform poorly, the bank can experience financial strains and might not be able to cover its liabilities. 3. Insufficient capital: banks are required to maintain a certain amount of capital to cover potential losses. If a bank doesn't accumulate enough capital, it can become vulnerable to financial difficulties. 4. Economic downturn: during periods of economic decline, banks may encounter higher loan defaults, lower lending and investment opportunities, and decreased profitability. When a bank fails, regulatory authorities step in to protect the customers and the overall financial system. In the United states, the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) oversees the process. The fdic may either find a buyer for the failing bank or liquidate its assets to pay back the depositors, up to a certain limit. This limit ensures the majority of depositors get their money back, which helps prevent panic among customers of other banks. In some cases, the government may choose to bail out a failing bank to prevent further financial harm to the economy, as was the case in the 2008 financial crisis. However, government bailouts may include conditions such as restructuring or downsizing the bank. In summary, banks fail when they can no longer meet their financial obligations due to excessive risk-taking or unforeseen circumstances. When a bank fails, regulatory authorities step in to protect depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system.	"This bank targets starts up. They have looser ""riskier"" profiles they will lend to and offer high returns for accounts. They were heavily invested in long term bonds. When the govt started raising bonds, existing bonds become less appealing because they had lower rates. This is important. When the govt raises the price to borrow, lending slows. Starts-ups.... Start up less because it expensive. Investment slow, banks taking in less money (assets. )now at the same time, the banks clients are feeling the same pressure so they withdraw money from the bank. The bank now has to sell the bonds it bought at a discount, essentially taking a less to pay back it's clients. Multiply this out and suddenly the bank fails because it can't repay everyone who is asking for their money because they've lost money. Think of this way - pretend 10 people gave you 1000 dollars each a year ago. You put $9000 in the stock market and hold on to $1000. The s&p has dropped ~8% in the last year so your investment is currently worth $8280all 10 people ask for their money back. You cover the first person with cash on hand ($1000)you cover 8 other people ($8000)you can only give $280 to the last person. You now have no money or investment (assets) and you still owe $720. Youre bankrupt (failed. )now the govt comes and steps in (in reality before you've sold all your investments) and takes your assets or has a healthy bank takeover. They pay the customers the federally protected amount $250k with any remaining money + govt money. If you were owed more than that you get certificate saying you'll get the rest if possible, but without certainty and not from the govt purse."

Why the difference? Why is there no way to recoup zelle definitely or wire transfer(maybe?) but if banks send money to wrong person there are severe penalties for not returning.	The main difference between the two scenarios is that banks have more authority and protection when they make a mistake, while individual transactions through services like zelle are often irreversible and rely on the goodwill of the recipient to return the funds. When a bank accidentally sends money to the wrong person, there are regulations and legal frameworks in place to help recover the funds. The recipient is generally obligated to return the money, and if they don't, the bank can take legal action against them. However, with peer-to-peer (p2p) payment services like zelle, once a transaction is completed, it is usually irreversible. These services prioritize speed and convenience over protection. When you send money to the wrong person via zelle, the onus is on you to contact the recipient and request them to return the funds. If they refuse, there is not much recourse available, and you are responsible for the mistake. It highlights the importance of double-checking information when making p2p transactions.	It largely depends on how the money is sent. Ach, wires, checks all have different rules (terms of service) to use those rails. When you sign up for zelle you agree to their terms of service which includes being sol for sending $$ to the wrong person. For the non-technical piece: banks know that they are going to make mistakes. I’m not going to say it’s collusion but let say that I work for bank a and send a wrong transaction to a customer at bank b. The next day bank a realizes this and tries to pull back funds. If bank b wants (depending on the rail used) they might be able to push back and collect the windfall for their customer. However, if bank b runs into a similar situation with bank a you know they aren’t going to help them. By working together, the banks can effectively lower their risk.

Coca-cola tailors its product offerings based on regional preferences and market demands. In the US, with a smaller population and similar tastes, fewer brands are needed to address consumer desires. However, worldwide, diverse populations have varying taste preferences, and the company must cater to these nuances. Offering a wider range of products globally allows coca-cola to better serve regional markets and appeal to a broader range of consumers, maximizing its market presence.	Each region has its own flavors. It's not like the US only has 70 and Canada has 500. Japan has flavors that won't sell in England. England has flavors that won't sell in South Africa.

Singapore became a wealthy nation by focusing on developing its human capital and trade infrastructure. As a small island nation with limited resources, Singapore's leaders invested heavily in education and skilled workforce development. They also created favorable business environments to attract foreign investment and promote international trade. Establishing a strategic maritime location and developing state-of-the-art port facilities further enhanced Singapore's role as a global trade hub. Consequently, a strong focus on education, trade, and investment fueled Singapore's rapid economic growth and wealth accumulation.	It’s an important trade hub, historically where ships coming from Europe would stop to trade with ships coming from China and Japan. If you look at its location on the map, Singapore is located exactly where a ship coming around the tip of India would pass on its way to the pacific. There are similar points of geographically bottlenecked trade in istanbul, tangier, cape town, the uae… if trade ships have to pass you, you might get rich middle-manning the trade.

It seems like hiking interest rates for loans for higher risk borrowers is counterintuitive. If they have to pay significantly more, aren't they more likely to default?	The main idea behind raising interest rates for high-risk borrowers is reflecting the increased risk the bank takes when lending money. Think of lending money as a business. The bank's goal is to lend money and earn interest on those loans, which is their profit. However, they also need to weigh the risk of not getting paid back. When a borrower is considered high-risk (based on credit history, income, or other factors), it means that the bank believes there is a higher likelihood of them not paying back the loan. To account for this increased risk, banks charge higher interest rates to high-risk borrowers. This way, they can offset potential losses from some loans that may not be paid back, with extra earnings from the higher interest on other loans. It's like putting extra insurance on something valuable you are lending to someone who might not be careful with it. However, it's important to note that banks do not want their borrowers to default on loans, so they take several measures to minimize this risk. They may require a larger down payment, ask for additional collateral or execute background checks, among other things. And when it comes to interest rates, banks assess various factors to calculate the rate that keeps default risk manageable while still making a profit. Ultimately, the practice of charging higher interest rates to high-risk borrowers is not intended to make it harder for them to pay off loans. Rather, it's a way for the bank to balance the risks involved in lending money to borrowers with different credit profiles, while still being able to make a profit.	Say you have $10,000, and you want to turn it into $11,000 by loaning it out. - you loan $100 to 100 people in low-risk group 1. Three of them will default; you'll get $0 from those. To get $11,000 back from the remaining 97, you need $11,000 / 97 or $113. 40 each. You need to set group 1's interest rate is 13. 40%. - you loan $100 to 100 people in high-risk group 2. Ten of them will default. To get $11,000 back from the remaining 90, you need $11,000 / 90 or $122. 22 each. You need to set group 2's interest rate is 22. 22%. You're suggesting the default rate depends on the interest rate. So let's suppose we have group 3, in group 3 we set the interest rate such that 9 of them will default. Doing the same math, group 3 gets $11,000 / 91 or $120. 87 each; you need an interest rate of 20. 87% to achieve your $11,000 goal. The critical question is then *how far do you have to drop the interest rate to make one less person default? *in other words, *does dropping the interest rate from 22. 22% to 20. 87% lower pressure on borrowers enough to save one loan out of 10 that would normally have defaulted? *in theory, it's qualitatively possible that this could indeed be the case. In practice, you'd need some real quantitative data about actual consumers to answer this question.

I understand why banks cannot pay people back in the moment, but wouldn't they still owe their depositors their money when they eventually do get the money back presumably once the recession is over?	In the event of a bank run, people may eventually get their money back if the bank survives and recovers. Banks owe the depositors their money, but during a bank run, they may not have enough cash immediately available. If the bank doesn't go bankrupt, depositors should receive their money once the situation stabilizes.	The logic of a bank run is the fear that the bank is on the verge of bankruptcy, so you need to withdraw your money before that happens. They were greatly diminished in the US by the creation of the FDIC, which guarantees a payout for depositors if a bank is insolvent.

Copyright and trademark are both legal protections for intellectual property, but they protect different things. Copyright protects creative works like books, music, and art, ensuring the creator has exclusive rights to reproduce or adapt their work. Trademark, on the other hand, protects brand identifiers like logos, names, and slogans, which help distinguish a company and its products from competitors. Essentially, copyright safeguards original creations, while trademark protects aspects of a brand's identity.	A trademark protects a brand's symbol or logo. A copyright protects content. So the ac/dc logo with the lightning bolt would be trademarked. The music and lyrics to thunderstruck would be copyrighted. Edit: eli10 addendum: just to be clear, the content of a copyright can also be an image. So the album cover to thunderstruck's album, razor's edge, would be copyrighted because it is artistic content owned by someone, but doesn't identify ac/dc as a whole.

I just seen a post showing a picture of a stack of (at least) 1000 notes of 20's in VB (venezuelan bolivar), which is apparently only equal to 1 US dollar.	Countries recover from hyperinflation by stabilizing their economies and restoring confidence in their currencies. This often involves a combination of fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms. 1. Fiscal policies: governments address their budget deficits by either increasing revenue (through taxes) or reducing spending. This helps to control the amount of money in circulation and demonstrates the government's commitment to financial stability. 2. Monetary policies: central banks can introduce a new currency, often pegged to a stable foreign currency like the US dollar, to regain people's trust in the value of money. This can be achieved by exchanging the old, inflated currency for the new one at a fixed rate. Central banks may also raise interest rates to discourage excessive borrowing and restrict the money supply. 3. Structural reforms: to support long-term economic stability, governments may implement policies that encourage business and investments such as privatizing state-owned enterprises, deregulating industries, and improving governance and transparency. For instance, after world war i, Germany experienced hyperinflation due to heavy war reparations and a weakened economy. In 1923, Germany's central bank introduced a new currency, the rentenmark, which was backed by assets and pegged to gold. This, along with fiscal discipline and international financial support, helped Germany recover from hyperinflation. In summary, countries recover from hyperinflation by stabilizing their economies through a mix of fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms, working to restore public confidence in their currency and promote long-term financial stability.	"Generally very tough road once hyperinflation takes place. Hyperinflation is only partially an economic issue - it is almost always a government policy issue. Corrupt and/or inept governments enacting unsustainable fiscal and monetary policy. 1) the ""stick it out"" route. The country keeps reissuing new currency that simply revalues existing currency. Hope to stabilize the economy in the mean time and avoid social unrest, civil war etc. Generally very low chance to succeed since the people in power who got the country there in the first place aren't that economically savvy. 2) issue new currency and peg it to some other currency or commodity (gold). Hard to do without assistance since the economy is likely in shambles. In modern times, this probably requires the support of something like the IMF and world bank and other governments and financial institutions (willing to lend to refloat the economy)3) dollarize. Abandon the currency and no longer issue currency. Formally adopt a foreign currency for domestic and international transactions. Usually the USD (hence the term) but, in theory, could be any currency. Informal dollarization occurs when citizens and businesses do this anyway and refuse to transact or hold local currency. Formal dollarization is the government actually doing this."

I understand how they got delayed initially, but what factors have prevented things from rebounding? For instance, I work in the medical field an am being told some product is ""backordered"" multiple times a week. Besides inventing a time machine, what concrete things are preventing a return to 2019 supplies?"	Supply chains have not fully recovered due to several ongoing factors. First, the covid-19 pandemic continues to cause disruptions and labor shortages, making it difficult to produce and transport goods at pre-pandemic levels. Second, the demand for certain products, such as medical supplies, has increased significantly, putting more strain on supply chains. Third, there have been logistical bottlenecks, such as port congestions and shipping delays, which slow down the flow of goods. Finally, natural disasters and geopolitical events, like the suez canal blockage, have added to these challenges. These factors combined have made it difficult for supply chains to fully recover and return to 2019 levels.	I can tell you what’s going on in my industry, aerospace manufacturing. Our material suppliers went through significant layoffs in 2020. They lost many skilled laborers to retirement and simply being laid off. Now that demand is back they can’t get the skill back that is needed to produce conforming product. They are hiring unskilled people and having extreme quality issues. Lead time prior to the pandemic was 3-5 weeks for material. Lead time now is 48-52 weeks.

A company's value is not solely based on its current net profit but also on its potential for future growth and profitability. Investors look at factors like market share, innovative products or services, and the company's overall business model. If they believe a company has strong potential to generate profits in the future, they're willing to invest, which raises the company's value. For example, a tech startup might not make a profit in its early years, but its innovative ideas could lead to significant earnings down the line, making it valuable to investors now.	The value of a firm is all of its future cash flows (cash in minus cash out) discounted to the present. Getting to this value of course requires conjecture, and investors will disagree about what those future cash flows might be. Those who believe they will be higher will buy stock; those who think it will be lower will sell it. The balancing point between the two determines the price of the stock, and the price of stock \* outstanding shares is the market valuation of the company.

"The invisible hand is an economic concept that refers to the unintended benefits for society that result from individuals acting in their own self-interest. It was first introduced by the economist adam smith in his book ""the wealth of nations. "" think of it like this: if a baker makes and sells bread to support his family, he's not doing it to feed the whole town. However, by making and selling bread, he indirectly contributes to feeding the town. This action, driven by self-interest, ends up benefiting everyone. The invisible hand is like an unseen force that guides people's actions to also create positive outcomes for others. In a free market, this principle helps to allocate resources efficiently, where supply meets demand, without the need for government interference. When individuals and businesses make decisions based on their own goals, the invisible hand ensures that these actions ultimately benefit the broader economy and society."	"The ""invisible hand"" is just the name given to the concept that with millions of individual actors acting in their own best interest, the markets will naturally gravitate towards the ""best"" versions of products/services and the most efficient use of money. There is no discrete entity guiding the economy (as was often the case historically) but rather an _invisible_ force that came about organically. So, for example, there would be no central player telling people to use a particular metal for building tools over another metal. Rather, buyers would gravitate towards tools made of a particular metal because it was better _for each individual buyer_ and blacksmiths would gravitate towards making tools of that metal because _each individual blacksmith_ sold more tools that way. No one colluded or decided on that metal, but rather the individual choices of each person would guide the market in that direction."

Basically, who is loving life right now?	"When interest rates rise in Australia, several parties potentially benefit. The primary beneficiaries are banks and financial institutions holding your mortgage. As interest rates increase, the amount you pay on your mortgage goes up, resulting in higher profits for the banks. Another group that may profit from higher interest rates is savers and investors. When interest rates rise, banks usually increase the interest rates on savings accounts and term deposits. This leads to more income for savers and those investing in interest-bearing assets, such as bonds. The australian government may also benefit indirectly. Higher interest rates can help control inflation, which is a key government objective. It maintains economic stability and can lead to more sustainable growth in the long term. So, while not directly ""loving life"" from interest rate rises, the government could see positive effects on the overall economy."	If the rate rises successfully curb inflation, then the beneficiaries are the general consuming public. Businesses, broadly speaking, don't like high interest rates. It increases borrowing costs and reduce investments. Investors don't like interest rate increases because it generally reduces share prices. Banks are in the middle. They might make more on loans but it is offset by reduced lending. On balance, it probably hurts them as well. Interest rate hikes are unpopular so it is rather unlikely the government or politicians are doing this for their immediate political benefit. On the other hand, high inflation is worse in the medium term for the government, the economy and the general welfare of the citizens. Bottom line, interest rate hikes are a bit like a bitter medicine that no one really likes but is probably necessary to stem inflation.

The credit card competition act aims to foster fair competition among credit card issuers by preventing them from colluding to set high fees merchants pay for card transactions. These fees, also known as interchange fees, partially fund credit card rewards programs. If the act leads to lower fees, credit card companies may have less revenue to fund rewards. This could result in a decline or elimination of such programs. Essentially, the act tries to create a more level playing field for businesses accepting credit cards, but it might come at the cost of rewards programs consumers currently enjoy.	The general idea is that right now, merchants pay money on every credit card transaction in their store. With this new act, the government wants to try to drive the cost of that fee down. But if they do that, then credit card companies might reduce or even cut out some reward benefits because they themselves would be earning less money. So the act does not say or do anything about rewards programs specifically. But if the credit card company ends up making less money, then they are less likely to keep giving money back to customers in the form of rewards.

The spike in house prices can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as low interest rates, limited housing supply, and increased demand. Let's break these factors down to make them easier to understand. 1. Low interest rates: central banks around the world have maintained low interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This makes borrowing money cheaper, so more people can afford to buy a house or invest in property. As a result, the demand for homes increases, and this drives up the prices. 2. Limited housing supply: in many areas, there's a limited number of houses available for purchase. This can be due to factors like strict zoning laws, slow construction rates, and land scarcity. When there are fewer homes to choose from, competition among buyers becomes more intense, leading to higher prices. 3. Increased demand: factors such as population growth, economic recovery after a downturn, and changing preferences (e.g. , the pandemic has increased demand for more spacious homes) contribute to a higher demand for housing. When more people want to buy homes, prices tend to rise. Historically, house prices do experience periods of decline, typically during economic recessions or when there's a housing market crash. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, many countries, including the United states, saw significant drops in housing prices. However, over the long-term, real estate prices have generally trended upward.	Since it hasn’t been explicitly mentioned yet: a lot of people don’t want to (or feel like they simply *can’t*) move because they’re sitting on a very low interest mortgage. In other words, let’s say you bought a $400,000 home a few years ago with 20% down and a 3% mortgage. You’d be paying around $2,200/month for principal and interest. (edit: for a 15 year mortgage. )that home might be worth $550,000 now, so you’d think it’d be a great time to move with all the equity. But people have to have somewhere to live, and if they can’t find a home they like for a lot less money, a different $550,000 home - even with ≈$160,000 down - will run you around $3,300/mo in mortgage payments at current ≈6% interest rates. In a nutshell, lower supply because people aren’t moving, means higher prices. Edit: as was pointed out, I had the 15 year box checked, not 30, when I ran those numbers - even though *technically* I didn’t specify, the assumption these days is for a 30 year mortgage. The numbers for 30 year mortgages would be $1,350/mo and $2,340/mo respectively.

Seltzer water costs more than sugary sodas mainly due to production and market demand factors. Seltzer water uses pressurized co2 to create carbonation, a more expensive process than sweet sodas, which rely on cheaper ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup for taste. Additionally, seltzer water is perceived as a healthier, upscale option, leading to niche markets and higher price points. Sugary sodas, on the other hand, have mass appeal and are produced in bulk, lowering the overall cost. The smaller market for seltzer water also means less competition, which allows manufacturers to charge higher prices.	Seltzer is not as widely popular as sodas, so they charge more for the product they expect to sell less of. If someone really wants it, they’ll pay the extra. On the other hand, in Japan sparkling water very common and popular. In contrast, sodas are treated as more of a treat than something you would drink multiple times a day. Brand name sparkling water like wilkinson, the tansan (by Canada dry), or suntory will typically cost around ¥110 for a 500 ml bottle (store brands are usually around ¥80). Soda bottles at the same size cost ¥140-160 at standard retail price.

A stock buyback is when a company purchases its own shares from the open market, reducing the total number of shares available to investors. This is often done when a company believes its shares are undervalued or when they want to improve financial ratios, such as earnings per share. The practice is sometimes frowned upon because it can be seen as a way for companies to manipulate their stock price and financial ratios. Instead of using their profits to invest in growth or pay dividends to shareholders, the company uses the money to buy back shares, increasing the price and benefiting those who may sell their shares. Critics argue that this method can benefit executives with stock options or bonuses tied to the stock price, without necessarily contributing to the long-term health of the company.	"If a company's main owners think it is going to do really well in the future, they'll buy back stock from smaller investors. This allows them to keep more of their profits, instead of having to pay it out in dividends. Normally, there's nothing wrong with doing that. But often companies today are whining with statements like ""it's too hard in this business climate! We need stimulus money! We need tax breaks! We can't afford to raise employee wages! We can't hire full time or provide benefits! ""if they are whining that they need cash / can't provide cash to their workers, and at the same time are reinvesting to maximize their own profits with the money they could have used on their workers, it sounds like blatant hypocrisy."

People are increasingly choosing suvs and crossovers because of their higher seating position, larger cargo space, and perceived safety benefits. Additionally, the improved fuel efficiency of modern suvs has diminished the traditional advantage of sedans in terms of gas mileage, making them less appealing overall.	The sedan isn't what was poplar in the first place. A five passenger vehicle with some cargo capacity that wasn't an awful driving experience and was affordable to drive even when there is only one or two people needing to go somewhere was what was popular. With today's emissions laws those are mid-sized suvs and crossovers.

Gold became universally precious mainly due to its rarity, attractive appearance, and unique properties. As a soft, dense metal that doesn't tarnish or corrode, gold is easy to work with and can be made into intricate designs. Because it's found on every continent, civilizations everywhere encountered gold and admired its beauty. People started using gold for decorations, jewelry, and religious artifacts, increasing its symbolic and cultural significance. Over time, gold's desirability and difficulty in obtaining made it valuable as a medium of exchange. Its scarcity and universal appeal led gold to become a staple of economic systems and solidified its precious status across cultures.	"Gold is sometimes called the ""noblest metal,"" because it doesn't readily oxidize. Most other metals oxidize - iron rusts, copper turns green, silver tarnishes, etc. But gold just kind of... stays gold. It's pretty scarce all around the world, you find it in a pure state (unlike most other metals which are mined as oxides, you mine gold as tiny flecks of gold in larger rocks,) and it's shiny. Once you have it, it's reasonably easy to work with because it's also the most malleable metal - you can pull gold into wires that are as wide as a single atom."

Or is this just another way to suck money out of people?	Digital convenience fees are charges for using online services, like paying bills or buying tickets. They may feel like a way to take more money from you, but their purpose is to cover the costs of providing and maintaining online platforms, such as website development, secure transactions, and customer support. Companies often outsource these services to third-party providers, who charge a fee for their expertise. The convenience fee is then passed onto the customer. While it may make transactions easier, there are still costs involved in setting up and maintaining these platforms, hence the fee.	"It depends on the product thats being sold. Technically every fee is just a way to extract more money from people, or due to some regulation. But they could also just include the ""fee"" in the overall price (such as airline fees are required to do). So it matters which actual fee you're talking about. ""digital convenience fee"" is too broad. That said, many ""convenience fees"" are related to costs for a credit card transaction. The vendor often passes that fee onto the consumer. When you see convenience fee, you should immediately think credit card fee, but not always the case"

And why would it ever be a good idea to borrow if you can pay cash and pay no interest to the bank?	If you can make more money doing something else with your cash than using it to pay down your mortgage, then it's beneficial to take out a loan. It depends on your credit rating what kind of interest you'll get on your loan, and what the long term stock market trends are, or if you want to buy multiple properties at the same time, for example. But making money in the stock market is not a given, so there is risk involved in going that route. Also, you want to have cash on hand for possible emergency situations, like big unexpected medical bills, your car dies, you lose your job, etc. On the other hand, if you lose your job and you have a mortgage, then you might end up defaulting on your loan, and lose the home and any of the equity you had in it.	The main advantage of borrowing money from a bank (a mortgage) to buy a house is that it allows you to purchase a property without having all the cash up front. This enables people to become homeowners earlier in life and potentially benefit from the appreciation of the home's value. Paying a mortgage also helps build credit history, which can be beneficial for obtaining future loans or credit cards. On the other hand, paying cash for a house has the advantage of no interest costs, which can save a substantial amount of money over time. Cash buyers may also have more negotiating power, as they are not reliant on bank approval and can close the deal quickly. In certain situations, it can be better to borrow money even if you have the cash. This is because investing the cash into diversified investments (stocks, bonds, etc. ) may provide better returns than paying off the mortgage early, although it comes with some level of risk. Additionally, having cash reserves can provide financial flexibility for emergencies or future opportunities.

Avatar 2 needs $2 billion to break even because the budget of $350 million covers only the production costs. This doesn't include additional expenses, such as marketing and distribution, which can be just as high, if not higher, than the production budget. To earn back these costs, the movie's revenue must be substantially more than the budget, especially since theaters and streaming platforms take a percentage of the box-office returns.	It doesn't.

I don't understand how something like this is possible at all. How can you sell a security and get actual money for it when you don't even possess it at all, even if borrowed? Wouldn't some party in the financial markets see that you didn't borrow these shares to short sell? Who is the interest that borrowed shares get going to if you didn't borrow them? I just don't understand how this process could even theoretically work without it being extremely obvious immediately that the shorting party is doing something fraudulent.	Naked short selling occurs when an investor sells a security without actually owning or borrowing it. While it may seem impossible, it can happen due to the logistical process of trading stocks and the complex nature of financial markets. Let's break down the concept into simpler parts to understand how it works and why it might not be immediately obvious. First, it's essential to understand the basics of short selling. Short selling is a legitimate way to bet against a stock, where an investor borrows shares and sells them with the hope of buying back at a lower price, making profit from the price difference. The investor has to return the borrowed shares to the lender eventually, closing the short position. Naked short selling, on the other hand, involves selling shares without actually borrowing them. The process is made possible because when a trade is executed, there's a period (usually two days) known as the settlement period, during which the buyer and seller confirm the details of the trade and transfer of the security takes place. During this period, the naked short seller hypothetically should be acquiring the borrowed shares to deliver. However, they don't, and instead, they rely on the complexity of the market and potential delays in the settlement process to their advantage. Now, you might wonder how it isn't immediately obvious that someone is engaging in naked short selling. The primary reason is that financial markets are vast, with millions of trades happening daily, and regulatory bodies like the sec may not be able to immediately detect fraudulent activities. Additionally, market participants, such as broker-dealers and clearinghouses, may not be aware of the naked short seller's intention, as they might assume that the shares have been borrowed. When it comes to the interest on borrowed shares, since the naked short seller never actually borrows the shares, they don't pay any interest. This gives them an unfair advantage and makes the practice financially enticing, which is one of the reasons why it's illegal. In summary, naked short selling is possible due to the time gap between trade execution and settlement, along with the complexities of the financial markets. The practice isn’t immediately obvious because of the significant number of trades and actors involved in the process. While regulatory bodies work to prevent and detect naked short selling, it can still occur, highlighting the importance of ongoing oversight in financial markets.	So the thing is, selling a stock isn't strictly an instant transaction where you give me money and I give you a stock. Rather, it's a contract: I *promise* that I *will* give you a stock by some time in the future. Note that this is actually similar to the way that many physical goods are ordered and delivered. When I go down to the grocery store to buy some eggs, I'm picking out eggs that are physically on the shelves. But other types of goods, like a major appliance or something, they don't have a pile of all the different models of fridges in the back. I'm buying something that the store doesn't physically have on hand, and they promise to deliver it in a week, and they'll get one from the warehouse or the manufacturer. Unless they don't. Supply chain issues. What happens then depends on the contract you signed. Still, we put up with the occasional unreliability because there ain't no way someone can have all the fridges on hand to sell, and the store doesn't want to order more inventory if they don't have a buyer lined up. Similar to short-selling: there's a buyer, there's *probably* a seller, stocks are fungible. We'll sort the details out later. For stocks, this works just fine in a regular market where you can know that you'll probably be able to buy a stock, and maybe you'll wait for the price to dip before you do. When the market is pear-shaped, then you can't buy the stock (or it costs too much). Failure to deliver a stock isn't illegal, but will have some contractual penalty. One way of thinking of it, is that the short-seller is buying *risk* and selling *certainty*. Both parties stake on the price *now*, and the short-seller is the one who is making a bet on the price fluctuating in the short-term. The buyer will get the stock, and even if they know the seller doesn't have it now, they have a guarantee that the seller will eat the difference if the price moves.

Mvnos, or mobile virtual network operators, like mint mobile, can offer cheaper plans than the actual carrier, like t-mobile, because they buy network access in bulk at wholesale prices. Think of it like buying groceries in bulk from a wholesale store: the more you buy, the cheaper each item becomes. Mvnos then resell this access to customers at a lower cost than the carrier's standard retail price. Additionally, mvnos often have lower operating costs because they don't need to maintain a physical network or infrastructure, and they typically spend less on marketing and retail stores. This allows them to pass the savings onto customers, making their plans more affordable.	"Mvno customers are sometimes given ""second class"" service prioritization. Mint's data service is a lower priority than some more expensive mvnos and the mainline carrier plans, if an area is congested with many mobile users, the lower priority customers will be among the first to see slower data speeds. (essentially, the mvno customers are just riding on unused network capacity at any time. )some plans tend to be more barebones. Mint's international roaming rates, even in Canada/Mexico, are pretty extreme. They don't offer an fully unlimited data plan, and their calling time is limited to just a few hours per day. Mint also requires annual upfront payments to maintain their lowest advertised pricing for single lines."
184	1ee3d64d-379c-4efb-b1ce-6e23faf1efb8.txt	Why are restaurants so hard to become profitable? I’m always hearing about restaurants losing so much money in the first few years. Why?	Restaurants face numerous challenges that make them difficult to become profitable, particularly in the first few years of operation. Firstly, the initial costs of setting up a restaurant can be quite high, including rent, interior design, equipment, and licenses. This means new businesses have considerable expenses to cover before they can even start making a profit. Secondly, competition in the restaurant industry is fierce, as diners have plenty of choices. This leads to a constant need for innovation and marketing to stand out from the crowd, which can be costly. Thirdly, the profit margins in restaurants tend to be relatively low, as the cost of ingredients, labor, and utilities can eat up a substantial portion of revenue. Since food prices can fluctuate, making consistent profits may be challenging. Additionally, managing a restaurant involves juggling many moving parts, such as maintaining quality food and service, training staff, and ensuring smooth operations. Inefficient management can lead to increased costs and potential loss of customers. Finally, customer preferences and trends can change rapidly, and a restaurant that was popular one day might struggle to attract diners the next. In summary, high initial costs, fierce competition, low profit margins, management challenges, and changing trends contribute to the difficulty of making a restaurant profitable, particularly in its early years.	Because there are a ton of upfront costs to design and build your restaurant. Plus, kitchen equipment is not cheap. Then you open and you have to have the exact right combination of food, service, and price on day one. If you are slightly off of any of those things, people will try you once and not go back. Or you won't get the rave review. Then even if you've got the right combination of price, food, and service, you still have to be in a location that can regularly fill your seats. If you are too big, then you are paying rent on space you cannot regularly fill and you have a commercial kitchen that is sized for an empty dining space... and you paid for and will continue to pay for both of those in the longterm.... eating up your profits. And finally, you have to spend money on food to prepare, and if you don't use it all, it goes in the trash. If you were a retail establishment, your unsold wares would just take up shelf space... at a restaurant, it's more money down the drain.

Twitter can survive despite laying off a large percentage of its workforce because companies often streamline operations by focusing on core business functions and automating certain tasks. This helps them maintain key services with a smaller team. Additionally, cost savings from workforce reductions can be redirected towards improving the platform and attracting new users. By prioritizing essential operations and adapting their business model, twitter can overcome the challenges caused by downsizing and continue to thrive in the competitive social media market.	Most of a company like twitter's workforce doesn't have the job keep the the existing site up and running, most of them are developing new features for the site, marketing the site to new and existing users, and other jobs that are important but not directly related to keeping the existing site running. If a new owner doesn't want to add features or market the site, they can keep the people directly involved in maintaining the site while letting everyone else go and keep the existing site running with a much smaller team.

I'm probably just stupid 😭	Life insurance works by pooling the money collected from many policyholders who pay premiums, like the $40/month you mentioned. The insurance company invests this money and earns profits. Most policyholders will live longer than their policy's term, like the 10 years, and the company keeps the premiums they paid. However, some people will pass away within that term, and the insurer has to pay out the large life insurance sum, like $500,000. The insurer uses their investments and other policyholders' premiums to cover these payouts. Additionally, the insurance company calculates the risk of someone dying based on factors like age and health, and adjusts the premium accordingly to make sure they collect enough money to cover payouts.	The vast majority of life insurance is term life insurance, which covers for a specific period of time. Typically, one gets term coverage for a period of time like until kids would be adults or house is paid off. So some 30 year old who just bought a house and had a kid might get a 30 year term policy, which then covers them from age 30 to 60. Since most people don't die in that age span, most policies don't pay out. The 20 policies that don't pay out for every one that does cover the costs. Plus, those $40/mo are invested by the insurance company and grow beyond just setting aside the money.

I get why a bailout can be important for the economy but I don't get why the company just gets the money. Seems like tax payer money essentially is ""buying"" the company to me but they get nothing out of it."	"When a company is bailed out with taxpayer money, it doesn't mean the public owns the company because the bailout is more like a loan or an investment. The government helps the company financially to prevent its collapse, which could negatively impact the economy and job market. In return, the government usually receives some form of compensation, like stocks, bonds, or a promise to repay the loan. This way, taxpayers could potentially benefit from the company's future success. However, full ownership is not granted because it might disrupt the balance of the free market system. Also, not all companies get this bailout opportunity, only those considered ""too big to fail"" or crucial to the economic structure."	"Why is it not owned by the public now? It depends on the type of bailout. It's often a loan (that must be paid back), or a purchase of shares (which the government later sells, hopefully at a profit). Very rarely is it no-strings attached. &#x200b;>seems like tax payer money essentially is ""buying"" the company to me but they get nothing out of it. Inaccurate. For example, in 2008 under the tarp program, in addition to an emergency loan, the US government bought $45B worth of preferred stock in citigroup, a larger bailout than any other recipient in the $400B+ program. When the government sold its stake, they had made a $12B in profit on citigroup. Part of an overall $15B in profit from the whole program."

Seeing a meme on Tiktok about people lamenting the fact that they brought a home at mortgage rates lower than 3. 0% between 2020-2022 and how they will never be able to move into a new home."	The meme is highlighting the fact that people who bought a home with a historically low mortgage rate (below 30% between 2020-2022) have locked themselves into a great deal. The downside is, if they want to move to a new home in the future, they may face higher mortgage rates, making the new purchase feel like a bad deal compared to their current home. Imagine getting a monthly subscription to your favorite streaming service for $5 instead of the usual $10. If you ever want to switch to a new streaming service, but the cheapest available option is $10, you might be reluctant to give up your great $5 deal. In summary, the meme is a lighthearted way of saying those who locked in low mortgage rates may hesitate to move in the future due to potentially higher rates on a new home purchase.	They can’t actually never move out. They could totally choose to sell their house and buy a new one. But, because they got such a low mortgage rate, any new mortgage rate they got now would be much higher. Meaning their interest payments percentage-wise would be much higher. Which to some people feels like a waste of money. Why buy a new house and pay 6% interest when you have a house right now that you only pay 3% interest on. It seems like a waste. Obviously the actual cost of the house matters too, if someone moved from a 1 million dollar house to a $250,000 house then obviously they could afford it even if the interest rates were higher. But generally speaking people don’t make that big a jump in housing costs.

When tech billionaires lose money, it's mainly due to decreases in their companies' stock prices. The money doesn't physically go anywhere or transfer to someone else; rather, the value of their assets shrinks. When stock prices drop, shareholders' wealth decreases, but new investors might benefit by purchasing stocks at lower prices and eventually selling when prices recover.	"No one gained it, its just ""on paper"". It works as the same principle as a house. My house when I brought it was 280k, it peaked at 500k so technically on paper I gained 220k. Now it dropped to about 420k and I lost on paper 80k. No one gained the 80k I lost."

Talking about wages is considered taboo because it can create tension and jealousy among coworkers if there are significant differences in pay. Employers often discourage discussions to prevent potential conflicts or demands for raises. This tradition has roots in social norms that associate money with personal worth, making discussions about income feel intrusive and uncomfortable for some people.	"Because companies used to be able to fire people for talking about their wages, and keeping that information secret is to the company's advantage. Thankfully, discussing your wages is a federally protected right now in the USA (and in many other, more civilized places), so by all means discuss discuss discuss!

Otherwise that isn’t even one burger in the US. Do these countries also have significantly cheaper food and materials as well?	In countries with cheaper currency like India, the cost of living is generally lower, meaning food and other essentials are more affordable. Prices are adjusted according to the local economy and purchasing power. For example, a burger that costs $1 in the US might cost 50 Indian rupees (less than $1) in India. So while the currency value is lower, the cost of food and materials is also lower, allowing people to maintain a reasonable standard of living.	Yes, things are a bit cheaper in India, for various economic reasons. I want to add though that the fact that a unit of currency in one country is worth 100 units of currency in another country isn’t itself super important in terms of price. In Japan, there are about 100 yen to one US dollar. All that really means is that the prices have two extra zeros. So a sandwich is 500 yen instead of 5 dollars.

I can't see the downside to houses getting cheaper. What kind of struggles do homeowners go through when the market is down? What else changes besides the price of their home? I know almost nothing about economics so a simple explanation would be appreciated.	">i can't see the downside to houses getting cheaper. You're only thinking about buyers, not owners. For people who already own homes, if home values fall quickly, owners can find themselves underwater on their mortgages, which means they must either stay in the house until the market recovers or sell and lose money. When home prices drop during housing market crash, homeowners can end up owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth and can no longer sell their homes to get out from under crushing mortgage payments. People with floating interest rate mortgages will suddenly see their monthly mortgage payments skyrocket because their interest rates have gone way up, if they cannot make the new, higher payments, they will lose their homes to foreclosure and often have to file for bankruptcy in the process, ruining their credit and their ability to obtain future mortgages or other types of loans for many years. In short, housing market crashes can financially decimate homeowners. &#x200b;edit: I didn't plan on addressing any of the comments on here but I've seen enough comments along the lines of ""homeowners deserve it"" or ""it's their fault for gambling on a home loan"" or ""their fault for not planning better"" or ""i have to pay rent so its good that homeowners suffer like me"" that I need to speak up. People making this comments are ignorant and spiteful. The vast majority of homeowners are middle class families who bought their homes to live in. Their homes are the only thing they will ever own with substantial value and the only thing they will ever own of substantial value that they can pass on to their children. So much of the reason for racial wealth inequality in the u. S. Is because for a really long time (and to some extent, still today), black people could not get home loans and thus could not pass on a home to their children to build up inter-generational wealth the way that white people could. Yes, there are people out there who own homes for shitty reasons such as flipping or renting, but when you're shitting on homeowners, you are by and large shitting on the average family. Does that make you feel good?"	"A housing market crash is considered a bad thing mainly because it leads to a domino effect of negative consequences for homeowners, banks, and the overall economy. To understand this, let's break down the concept into different parts and see how they are interconnected. 1. Homeowners: when the housing market crashes, the prices of houses drop significantly. Many homeowners experience a decrease in the value of their property, often below the amount they still owe on their mortgage (the loan they took to buy the house). This situation is called ""negative equity"" or being ""underwater"" on your mortgage. When this happens, selling the house won't be enough to pay off the mortgage, causing financial struggles for the homeowner. 2. Foreclosures: due to the drop in house prices, coupled with other financial strains like job losses, many people start defaulting on their mortgage payments. Banks then often resort to foreclosing these homes, which means they seize the property to recover their losses. The surge of foreclosures floods the market, causing house prices to fall even more, creating a vicious cycle. 3. Banks and lending institutions: when many people default on their mortgages and banks are unable to recoup their losses through foreclosures, banks find themselves in a difficult position. They may face liquidity issues or even bankruptcy, which impacts their ability to give loans to other customers. This can then result in a credit crunch, where it becomes difficult for people to obtain loans, further slowing down the economy. 4. The economy: a housing market crash can lead to a general economic downturn. Decreased consumer confidence, job losses, and reduced spending can lead to businesses struggling, as people are less likely to make significant investments like buying homes. In this situation, the government may need to step in and undertake measures to stabilize the economy, such as bailout packages for banks or stimulus bills aimed at jumpstarting economic growth. In summary, a housing market crash may seem like a good thing if you only focus on lower house prices. However, it triggers a cascade of problems for homeowners, banks, and the economy as a whole. When people can't pay off their mortgages, the housing market becomes saturated with foreclosures, and banks face financial stress. This, in turn, leads to tighter lending practices, decreased consumer spending, and ultimately, a weakened economy. The consequences of a housing market crash are not just limited to house prices; they extend to various sectors and can negatively impact people's lives on a broader scale."

I feel like the return on investment would be next to 0, am I wrong? How wrong?	Energy is the input for everything we do. Growing crops? You need energy for the planting/harvesting equipment, fertilizer, and pesticides. The internet? All electricity. Factores? Electricity. Iron/steel/copper/aluminum? Coal and energy in the form of heat or electricity. Oil and fossil fuels have been the #1 source of energy for us for more than a century. We're shifting toward more renewables, but it still only makes up a small part of our energy use. Nuclear provided a lot, but once you take into consideration transport uses it's pretty small. Oil subsidies generally work to keep supply, and therefore prices for energy, stable. Also, to expand supply before demand pushes oil prices too high. That's the main benefit. Keeping prices for the input to everything we do stable. Global inflation is up recently due to a lot of factors. But a big one is energy prices, because fundamentally everything's price is dependent in part on how much energy costs. You really just need to look at a graph of inflation and oil prices. You'll notice that when oil prices go up, inflation does too. When it goes down, inflation is low. They're not 100% aligned, but there's an impact.	Oil subsidies, simply put, are financial assistance provided by governments to oil companies, enabling them to lower production costs and sell oil at a cheaper price. This might seem like a huge cost with little return, but there are several reasons why countries choose to invest in these subsidies. First, lower oil prices help stimulate economic growth, as industries and consumers benefit from cheaper energy costs. Businesses can expand more quickly, and consumers have more disposable income which they can spend on other goods and services, thereby boosting various sectors of the economy. Second, countries with large domestic oil reserves use subsidies to protect their domestic oil industry, ensuring their companies can compete on the global market. Employment in the oil industry is often an important factor to consider for these nations, as many jobs depend on a thriving oil sector, which contributes to a stable economy. Lastly, oil-producing nations often use subsidies to exert geopolitical influence, as lower oil prices can put pressure on competing nations with higher production costs. This can give them a strategic advantage on the world stage. In summary, while a $1 trillion investment in oil subsidies might seem counterintuitive at first glance, there are various reasons why it can be financially positive. Lower oil prices can stimulate economic growth, protect domestic industries, and give countries geopolitical leverage.

Companies took advantage of the pandemic and it's associated supply chain issues, and used that as an excuse to raise prices. They claimed that they needed to cover increased costs on their end, but have been bringing in record profits. Https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/until 2019, inflation was generally made up of ~62% labor increases, and ~11% profit increases. From 2019 to today, it's ~8% labor, and 54% increased profits.	Inflation occurs when the overall cost of goods and services increases. While increased money circulation can contribute to inflation, other factors like supply and demand, production costs, and global events play a significant role too. For instance, a shortage in supply or increased production costs can lead to higher prices. So, even if real-time wages are down, various external factors can still drive inflation, making goods and services more expensive over time.

The issue is the ratio of the working population to the retired population. If population is shrinking then there are less workers for each retiree which means that those people have to either pay higher taxes or work longer. So a declining population results in the current generation having a more difficult life than the previous one. That's just the first order effect. There's lots of second order effects too. For instance, shrinking population causes low economic growth and low growth causes increasing inequality. Long story short a declining population ends up being a massive burden on younger generations. Most of the problems you hear about in first world today are either directly or indirectly related to the low fertility rate.	A birthrate below 2. 1 children per woman is considered bad because it leads to a declining population. While a smaller population might seem beneficial for an automating society, it can create problems in other areas. For example, a shrinking population means there will be fewer working-age people to support the growing number of elderly citizens who require social services, health care, and pensions. This can strain a country's economy and social systems. Additionally, a declining population may lower demand for goods and services, causing economic stagnation. So, while automation might reduce the need for some jobs, maintaining a healthy birthrate is still important to balance various societal needs.

Having been to Germany several times, France and Switzerland, and living in America, simple things like a water bottle in the US being $1.99 vs €1.29 or less in Germany. Or in the US the average shampoo costs anywhere from $7-$15+ while in Germany at many stores it is €2.50-€5 and it’s arguably better quality.	The main reason for the price difference between products in Europe and the US/Canada can be attributed to factors like taxes, subsidies, regulations, and market competition. In Europe, value-added tax (vat) is already included in the price of goods, while sales tax in the US is added at the point of sale. European countries often have higher taxes on goods, which can lead to lower prices due to subsidies or price controls, especially for essential products like water. Additionally, European markets tend to have more competition among retailers, driving down prices. The cost of living and average wages can also influence pricing. For instance, higher wages in the US might result in higher prices to pay for labor. Finally, currency exchange rates can change the perceived cost of goods between countries, especially when comparing prices in different currencies.	So part is it is currency values change. But Europe has better regulations and more protective price controls than the US in general. Many products made under the same brand name in both regions can literally have different manufacturing ingredients and processes to meet European standards. For example hershey products made in America don't even qualify as chocolate in Europe. Finally volume sizes may differ. For example in the US a common bottle size for water/soda is 20 oz/ 0.57l and the European standard may differ. So the next series of question is simply are you comparing the same brand, product, with the same dimensions sold in the same kind of shops? Convenience and pharmacy store prices in the US are higher than a general grocery store, and I don't know the common methods of shopping in Europe.

A debit chip or tap-to-pay is more secure than a mag strip because they generate unique codes for each transaction. Think of the mag strip like a static password that stays the same every time, making it easier for thieves to copy and clone your card. On the other hand, a debit chip or tap-to-pay acts like a constantly changing password that can only be used once, making it much harder for fraudsters to steal your information. The constant updating of codes in chips and tap-to-pay systems enhances the security of your transactions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your account.	The information on a magnetic stripe is static. Anyone with a reader or skimmer can take that information, duplicate it, and use it to make purchases. The chip is dynamic. It is actually a computer chip. The codes used by the chip change with each purchase, in a manner that is predictable only to the people that set it up. So reading the information from the chip doesn't help you unless you also compromise the databases of the institution that set it up. But if you can do the latter, you don't need to read the chip in the first place.

Billionaires often donate to large charities, research, or political causes, which may not produce immediate or visible effects. Additionally, some donations are spread across multiple years or locations, further diluting their impact. While change does occur, it may not be directly linked to a specific donation, making it harder to recognize the impact of billionaire philanthropy.	You would have to compare to a world where they did not donate to observe the difference. Billion dollar donations are rare, often benefiting research, or to address a massive population, possibly in another country.

The US trade deficit isn't inherently bad, as it can indicate strong consumer demand and investment in foreign products. However, a large, persistent deficit may signify dependency on foreign goods and debt. While having a trade surplus can be advantageous, it is not necessary for a healthy economy. The key is to balance import and export policies, ensuring competitiveness while maintaining sustainable national growth and well-being.	Not particularly bad, it means the USA is getting a higher value of stuff shipped in than shipped out. The potential downside is that the USA could become too reliant on imports and unable to cope when something disrupts them or you have an issue when too much of your currency is controlled by foreign entities but none of those are necessarily issues, just potential issues.

The feeling of businesses and services being short-staffed is due to various factors like skill mismatch, geographical distribution of people, and economic conditions. People may not have the skills required for available jobs or live far from areas with job opportunities. Additionally, companies are often reluctant to hire due to budget constraints or optimizing for efficiency. For example, some businesses in big cities have job openings, but many qualified people live in remote areas or have skills that don't match the available positions, leading to short-staffing situations.	Its simply because business don't want to pay for employees. The big bosses in charge always want to see financial growth, even if it means trimming people from jobs. That way, the payroll is a few hundred dollars cheaper but their own pays and bonuses can remain intact. This almost always collapses in on itself, since you have less people doing more work. This is how you get strikes. But the take away is short-staffing is always, 100% of the time, because business are prioritizing profits over people.

But it seems to me if I take out a 10 year policy that costs $100 per month, I'm betting that I'm going to die within that period of time and the company is betting that I won't or that they won't have to pay out. If I get to the end of that 10 year term, then I'm just out $12,000. What am I missing?	The main benefit of a term life insurance policy is to provide financial protection for your loved ones in case you pass away during the specified term. Think of it like a safety net: it ensures that, if something were to happen to you within the covered period, your family would receive a payout to help cover things like lost income, expenses, or debt. In your example, you're right that you pay $100 per month for a 10-year term, and if you don't pass away within that time, you don't get any money back. It's important to remember that the purpose of term life insurance is not to be an investment or a way to make money, but rather a way to protect your family's finances in the case of an unfortunate event. Additionally, term life policies are generally more affordable and straightforward compared to other types of life insurance (such as whole life). This makes them a popular choice for people who want to provide financial security for their family without breaking the bank.	The idea of a term policy is that it provides short term coverage. So for example let's say you live in a single income household, have a young child, a stay at home spouse, and a mortgage with 20 years left on it. A term policy is intended to provide financial assistance for your family should you die before you've had enough time in the labor market to build a large savings to leave behind/cover your bills. Don't think of it as a financial investment, because all insurance is a bad investment. The benefit offered by term insurance may or may not be of value to you, but it's not intended to be a good financial investment. Edit: a term life insurance policy offers the same benefit as a more expensive whole life policy, except doesn't build value like a whole life policy does, and therefore is much cheaper to purchase.
203	b508a194-bd7d-4c38-9904-227fd1f09aeb.txt	How does a 10% decrease in the number of egg laying hens equate to a 300% increase in the price of eggs?	The relationship between a 10% decrease in the number of egg-laying hens and a 300% increase in the price of eggs can be explained through the concept of supply and demand. Supply and demand is like a seesaw that balances the amount of a product available (supply) and people's desire for that product (demand). Imagine a town where all the egg-laying hens produce exactly 100 eggs per day, and everyone in town wants to buy those 100 eggs. If suddenly 10% of the hens couldn't lay eggs anymore, the supply drops to 90 eggs a day, while the demand for eggs is still at 100. Since there aren't enough eggs to go around, people start offering more money to secure the limited supply of eggs, which drives the price up. This price increase might not directly be proportional to the decrease in hens, but it reflects the scarcity of the product, the urgency of the demand, and the willingness of people to pay more for the limited supply of eggs, which can lead to a significant increase	"Economists call this ""inelastic demand"". It just means that people are willing to pay more to get the product, making it easy for prices to rise dramatically in a shortage. Sometimes the cause is that there's no alternative, as when gas prices spiked in the 1970s, or if all food runs short. If there are alternatives then rises tend not to be so dramatic. In the case of eggs the evidence is that people are willing to pay more to have them rather than do without eggs or products that contain eggs. In most cases eggs were a relatively small part of consumers' budgets so many can afford to pay quadruple. (300% more means quadrupling, just as 100% more means doubling. )in short, a 10% shortfall in supply will cause the price to keep rising until 10% of the consumers drop out of the market."

Here is my eli5: let’s say the city you are in wants to build something. A new road, a library, whatever. So, your city asks a construction business to build those things. Of course, roads and libraries are expensive, so the city tells the construction company to start work, and they will pay them when the job is complete. The business agrees to start work because it knows that your city will keep its promise and pay them later. Now, the road and library are built, and the city officials have decided not to pay the construction company. At first, the construction company is upset and sues the city, but other construction companies take note. Now when your city needs something else built, like a playground or a new airport, companies will not believe your city when they promise to pay after the work is complete. This means that the city will have to pay the construction companies more money upfront to get to work. Also, since fewer companies want to do business with you, the ones who will do bad work. So, let’s apply that to the country. The US has a great reputation in the world for paying its debts. In fact, most countries trust the US so much that they will only accept goods and services in US currency. If the US defaults on its debts, all of a sudden other countries will not want to trade with the US anymore. In fact, even holding US dollars seems like a bad idea. So they trade them for something else, which means that the US dollar loses value as everyone tries to get rid of it. That means that the US dollar in your pocket all of a sudden cannot buy you your groceries; your European cheese, Indian spices, and mexican vegetables all suddenly skyrocket.	"A default on US total debt would have far-reaching consequences on the country's economy and financial system, ultimately affecting individuals in various ways. In summary, a default on US debt would negatively impact interest rates, the value of the dollar, public services, and investments, while also potentially causing increased inflation and job losses. First, let's discuss what a ""default"" means. When a country like the US borrows money, it does so by issuing government bonds. These bonds are considered a safe investment because they're backed by the ""full faith and credit"" of the US government. A default would occur if the government failed to make timely payments on the principal or interest of these bonds. If the US were to default on its debt, financial markets would become unstable. Investors would view US government bonds as riskier, which would raise interest rates to compensate for that risk. Higher interest rates would make it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money, slowing down economic growth and potentially causing job losses. Furthermore, a default would weaken the value of the US dollar in global markets. The dollar is currently the world's reserve currency, meaning other countries hold large amounts of it to conduct international trade or to store wealth. If confidence in the US government's ability to pay its debts were to falter, the value of the dollar would drop. This could lead to increased inflation, as imports would become more expensive, ultimately raising the cost of goods and services for individuals. Additionally, a default on US debt would affect public services. If the government were unable to pay its debts, it might have to cut back on spending for services like education, healthcare, and public infrastructure. This could negatively affect people's quality of life and access to essential services. Lastly, a default would impact investments. Many people have some exposure to US government bonds, either directly or indirectly (through pension funds, mutual funds, etc.). In the event of a default, the value of these investments would decline, potentially causing financial losses for individuals. In conclusion, a default on US total debt would have serious and wide-ranging repercussions on the economy and the daily lives of individuals through higher interest rates, a weaker dollar, reduced public services, and damage to investments."

People can afford houses despite rising market prices and static salaries due to factors like longer mortgage terms, lower interest rates, and assistance from government programs or family support. Longer mortgage terms spread payments over a longer period, making them more manageable. Lower interest rates help reduce the cost of borrowing money. Government programs or family support can provide down payment assistance, making it easier to enter the housing market.	In addition to the good points everyone else has made about generational wealth, it’s also because a lot of people’s salaries aren’t staying the same. Just about everyone I know (i’m in my late 20s and live in the American south) gets raises every year or two, or switches jobs if they don’t feel they’re making enough in their current position. Those are the people who are buying houses.

For example: food prices, living expenses etc.	Prices generally increase over time due to a concept called inflation. Inflation is the gradual increase in the overall price of goods and services in the economy. Think of it like a slowly rising tide that lifts all boats, or in this case, prices. It's mostly driven by an increase in the money supply - when there's more money available, people tend to spend more, which leads to a higher demand for goods and services. This higher demand often results in increased production costs, as companies need to pay more for raw materials, labor, and other resources. These higher costs are then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. However, prices don't only increase. There are situations where they decrease, which is called deflation. Deflation occurs when there's a decrease in demand for goods and services, resulting in lower prices. This can sometimes happen due to technological advancements that lead to more efficient production, allowing companies to produce goods at a lower cost. While both inflation and deflation can occur, most modern economies aim for a certain level of low and stable inflation. This is because deflation can lead to economic instability, as consumers may choose to delay spending, expecting prices to continue falling, which can slow down the economy. Therefore, even though prices don't always increase, they tend to rise slowly over time as a result of inflation.	The economy is manipulated to always have some level of inflation. The opposite, deflation, is very dangerous and the government will do anything to avoid it. Imagine wanting to buy new sofa that costs 1,000. Next month it will be 900. Month after it will be 700. Would you buy it now? Or would you wait and save 300 bucks? Deflation causes the economy to come to a screetching halt because people dont want to spend more than they need to, so they decide to save their money instead. Because of this, a small level of inflation is the healthiest spot for the economy to be in. Somewhere around 2% is generally considered healthy. This way people have a reason to buy things now instead of wait, but they also wont struggle to keep up with rising prices. Edit: to add that this principle mostly applies to corporations and the wealthy wanting to invest capital, I just used an average joe as it is an eli5. While it would have massive impacts on consumer spending as well, all the people telling me they need a sofa now are missing the point.

In many companies, there's this policy which requires awarded budget that must be spent completely once it's approved. If the annual spend is below the allocated annual amount, there's a chance next fy you won't get the requested budget you asked for.	This policy exists to encourage departments to use their full budget to achieve their goals and ensure efficient resource allocation. If departments consistently under-spend, management may believe they can achieve the same results with less money. Unfortunately, this can lead to wasteful spending near the fiscal year-end. Carrying over unused funds could be beneficial, but it's not always implemented due to concerns about financial transparency and accountability.	If I give you 100 dollars to repair the sink, and you only spend 50 of it, next time I need the sink fixed i’m going to give you 50 dollars. The other 50 goes to other expenses or into savings. Companies use the same philosophy. Budgets which aren’t spent go straight to the bottom line of that years accounting, leading to more profits.

If you actually add up all the interest you pay over the course of a 30 year loan, it can be just as much as the original price of the loan or more. So if you have a good credit score, your loan is considered a fairly safe and reliable investment - you’re gonna pay your 5. 275% compound interest monthly with just as much reliability as any business or government would, and if you don’t they can foreclose. It’s not a super high-yielding investment, but it is a relatively safe one backed by the value of your home. Banks sell it off because they’d rather just pocket the loan origination fees and flip that money into more loan origination fees or some other higher yield investments.	When a bank sells your loan to an investor, it's called loan securitization. This process involves pooling multiple loans together and turning them into a single financial product, like a bond, which investors can buy. The main reason banks do this is to free up capital, so they can give out more loans and generate further income. Investors buy these loans because they earn money from the interest payments made by borrowers. By owning a small portion of different loans, investors diversify their investment, which helps reduce their risk. For example, if one borrower defaults on a loan, the impact on the overall investment is minimal. So, buying loans can potentially offer a stable income in the form of interest payments for investors, while the bank continues to lend money to new borrowers.

"" in short selling, you borrow shares of a stock from someone else and sell them at the current market price. Later, when the price drops, you buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the person you borrowed from, and pocket the difference. Essentially, you're making money from the decline in the stock's value. For example, if you short sell a stock at $100 and the price drops to $80, you earn $20 per share after buying them back and returning them."	I own a $1000 share in apple. You rent this share from me for 6 months and you pay me $50 in 'rent'. As soon as I give you the share, you sell it for $1000. During those 6 months the share drops from $1000 to $600. At the end of the 6 months you buy another share on the market for $600 and give this one back to me. You made $1000 from the sale and spent $600 to buy it back, so your profit is $400 (minus $50 in rent).

Prices in stores like costco and sam's club are much cheaper than your average grocery store because these stores operate as warehouse clubs, where merchandise is sold in bulk at discounted prices to their members. The main idea behind warehouse clubs is buying and selling products in large quantities, which allows them to take advantage of economies of scale. Essentially, when a business buys products in large amounts, the cost per unit goes down. This happens because suppliers often offer discounts for bulk orders, and purchasing in bulk reduces transportation and handling costs. Warehouse clubs pass these savings on to their customers by offering lower prices. For example, costco and sam's club often sell items in larger quantities or packs than a traditional grocery store would. This means that, while you might spend more money upfront when shopping at a warehouse club, you'll save money in the long run since you're paying less for each individual item. Another reason warehouse clubs can offer lower prices is their minimalistic store design and no-frills approach to shopping. The stores usually have large, open warehouse spaces with simple shelving units, which reduces overhead costs like rent and store fixtures. Additionally, warehouse clubs often have a smaller selection of products compared to traditional retailers, which simplies inventory management and increases the efficiency of operations. In summary, warehouse clubs like costco and sam's club can offer cheaper prices due to their bulk purchasing, economies of scale, simple store layout, and efficient operations, all of which lead to cost savings that are then passed on to the customer.	"They don't sell just anything, you will notice that while the core offerings are fairly consistent, the overall items they sell changes throughout the year. They are spot buying what they can get at a large discount. Because they offer far less ""choice"" than a regular store, they will buy significantly larger lots of a smaller number of items. This kind of bulk buying gets them discounts because the manufacturer that sells it to them is assured a large transaction. The seller has a streamlined process to only ship to a small number of stores and the buyer (costco, etc) can receive fewer but larger shipments. Much more efficient. They in turn sell to consumers in larger lots. Big boxes, full cases, big bottles. They eliminate the inefficiencies of lots of small things, and only stock, inventory, and process at checkout large efficient units. The stores are also designed to be very efficient with bulk storage right where it's needed. It not fancy, but makes their jobs of managing inventory much easier. Lastly some charge membership. The people who are shopping are willing to stake $50 a year to do so. They want be there and quickly learn the drill. That gets them in and out of there more efficiently.

212	94292e87-c621-4ebc-8ff1-613cfc8ceedf.txt	Why is it so much harder to afford a decent life than it was 50 years ago?	The primary reason it's harder to afford a decent life today compared to 50 years ago is due to the rise in income inequality, changes in the economy, and the increase in the cost of essential goods and services, like housing, healthcare, and education. First, income inequality has widened significantly in the last half-century. Technological advancements and globalization have increasingly shifted benefits towards those with specific skills or resources. This has led to a more significant portion of wealth being held by the top income earners, while the middle and lower classes have not experienced proportional growth in their incomes. Essentially, the rich are getting richer, and the poor are not improving as much, making it more challenging for many people to achieve a decent life. Second, the economy has undergone significant changes from manufacturing-based to knowledge and service-based. This change has led to a loss of well-paying jobs for those without higher education or advanced skills. Good jobs with benefits, pensions, and job security that were common 50 years ago are now much rarer. As a result, more people are working multiple jobs, relying on gig economy positions, or struggling to find stable employment, making it more challenging to earn a stable, livable income. Lastly, the cost of essential goods and services has increased. Housing prices, in particular, have skyrocketed in many areas faster than inflation or wage growth. This makes houses more expensive and less attainable for the average person. Similarly, the price of healthcare and education has increased dramatically, putting these essential services out of reach for many without government or employer assistance. In summary, while there have been significant technological and economic advancements in the last 50 years, the resulting changes in income distribution, the economy, and the cost of essentials have made it more challenging for many people to afford a decent life today than in the past.	"Controversial answer but here goes: rising income inequality. The world is more efficient per worker-hour now and overall more wealthy by measures of GDP. It's just that a majority of those gains are being locked away in the highest echelons. Western societies have tried subscribing to ""trickle down economics"" for the last several decades and it turns out that this experiment is a failure for the average worker. Wealth doesn't ""trickle down"", it just gets hoarded away at the top. Good if you're up there, bad if you're the 90% or more that isn't. Edit: it is worth pointing out that we do still live vastly improved lives on the aggregate than our great grandparents. (in the western world) reliable access to basic utilities is now almost universal, as is access to full secondary level education. Health outcomes have improved across the board, workplace fatalities are way down. Literacy is up, life expectancy is in general well up (but last I heard just starting to trend down again), and until just recently social mobility opportunity had increased as well. Never mind the access to media, entertainment, information, and travel opportunity that largely didn't exist for the common classes 50 odd years ago. There's a lot that has improved over the last few decades, it just isn't in proportion to the overall gains in the system. And, depending where you look and how you measure today, starting to trend in the wrong direction. (yes, I'm aware I'm speaking with some bias here. I know there's still a lot of outliers out there. )"

The bank of Japan increasing its interest rate from 0. 25% to 0. 5% means that it is making borrowing money slightly more expensive. This change can impact the economy in various ways, and it might cause panic in the markets due to potential negative consequences. Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you borrow money from a bank to buy lemons and sugar. If the interest rate for the loan is 0. 25%, you only have to pay back a little extra to the bank. But if the rate increases to 0. 5%, you'll have to pay back more, making it somewhat costlier for you to run your business. Now, apply this example on a larger scale across an entire economy. When interest rates rise, businesses face higher costs for borrowing money, which may lead them to invest less and slow down their growth. Consumers may also reduce spending and borrowing, as mortgages and loans become slightly more expensive. Altogether, this can potentially slow down the overall economic growth. The panic in the markets is mainly caused by investor uncertainty. Higher interest rates can make it harder for businesses to grow and generate profits, causing stock prices to fall. Investors, worried about potential losses, may start selling their stocks, leading to a drop in the markets.	The rise in borrowing costs has been mentioned which is true, but it also represents a bit of a paradigm shift that was a surprise to markets. The Japanese central bank had been keeping rates effectively zero whilst other central banks had been rising to manage inflation. Japan has not seen the same inflation as most other markets, for a number of reasons. Japan’s monetary policy remains very accommodative, but this is a move in the opposite direction, albeit somewhat marginal. The break in rhetoric from the bank of Japan caught market participants but surprise and markets reacted accordingly; bonds fell to adjust to the new rate regime expectations, equity markets overall fell, financial stocks rose, and the yen rallied. The australian stock market fell sharply as a flow on effect - there is a common trade (“carry trade”) whereby you borrow in Japan cheaply to invest in higher yielding markets like Australia. The rise in rates makes this less attractive, especially if there is more of this to come. Investors therefore would have closed out their higher yield paying offshore “long” positions and their “short” yen position which was the cheap borrowing leg.

Raising interest rates is a tool used by central banks, like the bank of Canada, to manage the economy and prevent a recession. In simple terms, it works by influencing how much money is circulating in the economy, thus affecting inflation and the overall economic activity. To understand this, let's first look at the role of interest rates. Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money or the return on savings. When interest rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, and saving is more rewarding. On the other hand, when interest rates are low, people and businesses are more likely to borrow money and spend it, thus stimulating the economy. Now, when the economy starts to overheat (grow too quickly), it often leads to high inflation. Inflation refers to the general increase in prices and the decrease in the purchasing value of money. To address this, central banks raise interest rates. By doing so, they encourage people to save more and borrow less, which in turn reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy. With less money flowing around, there's less demand for goods and services, which helps to stabilize prices and prevent the economy from entering a recession. Conversely, when the economy is struggling, central banks may lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, so consumers and businesses are more inclined to take out loans and spend money. This increased spending can help to stimulate economic activity and prevent a recession. In summary, raising interest rates is a way for central banks, like the bank of Canada, to manage inflation and prevent a recession. By adjusting the cost of borrowing and saving, they can influence the amount of money circulating in the economy and control its growth.	First you have to realize it’s all related to inflation. Inflation simply means that goods and services cost more now than they used to. Next you have to understand the law of supply and demand and how they relate to pricing. If supply is high and demand is low, prices go down. If demand is high and supply is low, prices go up. Combining these two, we can understand that prices are going up, because demand for those good and services is going up. So how does changing interest rates affect this? Well when interest rates are low, companies and people tend to take on more loans, since they are able to get that money cheaply. With more money to spend, they want to make use of that money, so they buy goods and services. But as already discussed, that means more demand, which means prices go up even more. But we don’t want prices to go up now, we want prices to go down. The only way to make prices go down is to either increase the supply more than the demand (something that a government can’t do in a capitalist society) or decrease demand. How can they decrease demand? Raise interest rates. With higher interest rates, companies and individuals do not borrow as much. As interest rates get higher, not only are they not borrowing as much, they are instead saving more and more of the money they do have. So raising interest rates lowers the amount of money being spent on goods and services, which lowers demand, which lowers prices.

You're focusing on the wrong metric. In a recession, there is less stuff being demanded. Businesses and consumers want to buy less stuff. This means people whose job it is to produce that stuff lose their job and then demand for stuff decreases further. We can measure this loss of productivity in dollars, but it's not that the dollars are going somewhere else. The stuff is just not getting made. More generally, there is not a fixed amount of money. Banks create money through lending (which slows down during a recession) and central banks can also, in effect, create new money (which they generally do during recessions).	A recession happens when the economy slows down, causing a decline in demand for goods and services. Due to this decreased demand, businesses make less money and may need to cut costs, often by laying off employees or reducing wages. As a result, more people face job insecurity or lower incomes, leading to an increase in poverty. The money doesn't vanish; it instead becomes concentrated, with the rich often getting richer during a recession. The reduced spending overall slows down economic growth, which means less wealth is generated, and various sectors of the economy receive less income than they previously did.

"Anna sorokin and other fraudsters exploit the delay between depositing a bad check and the bank discovering it's fake. Banks often make funds available right away, even though it takes time to verify the check's authenticity. This delay is called the ""float,"" and fraudsters use it to their advantage. They deposit bad checks in one bank and quickly withdraw cash from a different bank before the first bank can identify the check as fake. This loophole abuse lets them access the funds before being caught."	It's very common for banks to make a portion of a deposit available immediately as a courtesy for its customers. While it may take several days for the checks to clear and the customer to access _all_ of the deposit, it does tend to keep them happy if the bank floats a portion of the difference for a couple of days. Sorokin took advantage of this fact, depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bad checks, while only withdrawing tens of thousands against them.

The US banking system is not crippled by credit card fraud because of several protective measures and systems in place that help deter, detect, and prevent fraudulent activities. These measures work together to keep fraud at manageable levels, ensuring consumer trust and the overall stability of the financial system. First, banks and credit card companies invest heavily in advanced security measures, such as employing encryption and tokenization technology, to protect sensitive card information. This makes it harder for criminals to obtain usable card data in the first place. Second, there are multiple layers of fraud detection mechanisms in place, such as real-time monitoring and machine learning algorithms, which analyze transactions for unusual patterns and potential signs of fraud. If any suspicious activities are detected, the card issuer may decline the transaction, notify the cardholder, or temporarily block the card. Additionally, many online merchants use fraud prevention measures like address verification system (avs) and card verification value (cvv) codes, which require the buyer to provide additional information beyond just the card number, making it more difficult for criminals to use stolen data. Moreover, the US has implemented the use of emv chip cards, which are more secure than the traditional magnetic stripe cards. EMV chips generate a unique code for each transaction, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit the cards. Furthermore, federal laws in the US provide varying levels of consumer protection against unauthorized charges. For example, the fair credit billing act (FCBA) limits a cardholder's liability to $50 for unauthorized charges once reported, encouraging them to report any suspected fraud. In summary, while credit card fraud is a significant issue, the combination of security measures, fraud detection systems, merchant precautions, and consumer protections work together to prevent the US banking system from being crippled by credit card fraud.	While credit card fraud is a problem, it’s not overwhelming to banks. Just like stores expect some shoplifting and include the costs of that in their prices, banks expect some fraud and include those costs in the fees they charge. Banks also have lots of ways to detect fraud, and can often catch it before there are too many charges. They have algorithms that look for charges outside a customer’s normal area, at places they don’t normally shop, etc. When I’ve had a fraudulent charge, the bank itself has always been the one to catch it and call me. Also, you need more than a credit card number to shop. In person, you need the card itself. If a store runs just the number off a piece of paper, they would be liable for the charges. Spoofing cards is harder, especially the new chip cards. Online, you typically need the security number from the back of the card and the billing address. You can buy full sets of stolen data, of course, but it’s harder than straight numbers. As to why every criminal in America doesn’t take up credit card fraud, on the whole a lot of crime is opportunistic rather than carefully planned. Someone needs money *now*, so they smash a window or bump key a door, grab some stuff, and leave. Or rob someone in person. Credit card fraud takes start-up capital (to buy the devices and numbers), planning, and patience.

The concept of minting a $1 trillion coin to resolve outstanding debt is based on a legal loophole in the United states, which allows the treasury to mint platinum coins of any denomination. However, while this may seem like a straightforward solution to paying off national debt, it would have significant economic ramifications. First, let's discuss how the $1 trillion coin would work. The treasury would mint the coin and then deposit it into the federal reserve. In exchange, the federal reserve would credit the treasury's account with $1 trillion, which could then be used to pay off outstanding debt. This would not require creating any new taxes or borrowing money, hence the appeal of the idea. However, using the $1 trillion coin as a solution to the debt crisis would have adverse effects on the economy. One major issue is inflation. Injecting $1 trillion into the economy could cause a sudden and dramatic increase in the overall money supply, which in turn could lead to rapid inflation. Inflation diminishes the value of money, making it more expensive for people to purchase goods and services, resulting in an overall decrease in purchasing power. Moreover, the $1 trillion coin would undermine the trust and confidence in the u. S. Financial system. The government would essentially be creating money out of thin air, thereby raising concerns among domestic and international investors about its ability to manage its finances responsibly. This could lead to a loss of confidence in the u. S. Dollar and further destabilize the global economy. Furthermore, using the $1 trillion coin to combat the debt problem would only be a temporary solution. The u. S. Government runs a budget deficit most years, meaning it spends more than it earns in taxes. Relying on such an unconventional method to address debt would not address the root causes of the problem, such as high government spending and inefficient taxation mechanisms. In conclusion, while the $1 trillion coin may initially appear to be a simple solution to the u. S. Debt problem, it would likely result in inflation, undermine confidence in the u. S. Financial system, and fail to address the root causes of the problem. It is essential to approach the issue through more sustainable methods, such as reducing government expenditures,	"Every comment here is wrong. First, we need to understand the problem. It is really easy to get the order of things wrong. The US government already ordered so much spending, which, yes, is greater than the taxes it brings in. In order to finance the spending the US issues debt, that is sought after and wanted by many parties both inside and outside the US. Since congress ordered this spending, the government has no right not to spend the money. The debt limit is a relic of WW1 where congress went from approving every individual bond issued by the US to telling the treasury, ""you do it, just don't go above this limit without our say so"". Now, the US government has hit that limit and needs permission to go higher since the spending has already been ordered. This is analogous to buying something on a credit card and deciding at a certain point you have too much debt, so you just aren't going to pay the bill. Not that you will spend less, but that you won't pay for what you already bought. This long explanation is to say the only problem with the US government paying its debt is not lack of funds or willing creditors it is an arbitrary limit that was decided on for no real reason. The coin gets around this arbitrary, made-up limit by increasing the assets the US officially has, so the net debt is lower, and thus, the debt limit has not been reached. If it is legal it will have no, zero, knock on effects to the economy. Of course, that isn't going to happen because if it did, then congress could just normally raise the limit normally and the coin would not be necessary."

Say country A sends some billions of dollars to country B in aid or in exchange for some resource. How does the actual transfer take place? How does the wealth of country A decrease and the wealth of country B increase?	Large sums of money are transferred between nations through electronic bank transactions, typically using the swift network. Central banks of each country hold foreign currency reserves, and when a transfer occurs, they adjust their reserves accordingly. This process doesn't involve physically moving cash, just adjusting numbers in the central banks' systems.	Nations have state banks, such as the federal reserve in the United states. The transactions happen over a wire system, like fedwire or swift. In straightforward transaction like you are supposing, it's just like any other international money transfer, only with larger amounts and between public banks controlled by the state.

(mainly food) I guess this really is me being very very dumb but does someone have a thorough explanation of why things rise when it's placed in the oven or somewhere really really hot? (cake dough for example) as I was mainly just told that things rise in the oven.	"*things* in general do not rise when heated in the oven. Put a lasagna in the oven and it comes out the same as when it went in (just... you know... cooked). *dough* rises because it has something called a ""leavening agent"", which just means ""a thing that makes the dough rise"". This could be yeast (they burp out lots of carbon dioxide gas as a *biological* reaction, which gets stuck inside the cooking bread and expands, pushing the bread) or baking soda and baking powder (which do the same thing but as a *chemical* reaction)."	When things are heated, their molecules move faster and spread out, causing the substance to expand, which is known as thermal expansion. In the case of cake dough, the heat from the oven causes the baking powder or baking soda to react, producing gas bubbles. These gas bubbles get trapped within the dough, causing it to rise and expand. The heat also makes the dough's proteins coagulate and the starches gelatinize, which help to set the structure of the cake as it cools, maintaining its fluffy, risen shape.

So it's technically possible those ingredients are processed in such a way that they make it so the human body can't access those calories anymore. But that is basically never what happens, I cant even think of an example of that. What *is* happening is that nutritional labels are allowed to round down so for example, tic tacs are just pure sugar, which definitely has calories. But each tic tac has less than 5 calories so they can say it has zero.	A product can have zero calories because the ingredients it contains are not digestible or absorbed by our bodies, so they don't contribute to our calorie intake. For example, some artificial sweeteners have caloric components, but their sweetening power is so much stronger than sugar that only tiny amounts are needed. Since our bodies can't break down these sweeteners, their calorie content doesn't affect us, making the product essentially calorie-free. This allows manufacturers to label it as a zero-calorie product.
223	366ae309-bc7f-49b2-862c-89ca1d0cc77f.txt	Is there a limit on how many different metals can be mixed into an alloy, and what would the results of alloying many different metals together be?	Well there’s a hard limit on the periodic table - there’s only so many different metallic elements. More practically, you’ll want some chemical/structural synergy between the elements you’re alloying to produce a final product that has superior properties than the components. This means you’re looking specifically for another metal that is soluble in the major component and will modify or gap fill the crystal structure just right. Not all metals are soluble or stable in eachother, and some will separate out like oil and water or corrode if you try to blend them. But if you just wanted a messy and useless slag of all the stable metallic elements cooled into a crispy oxidized lump of jumbled phases and crystals, sure you could do that.	In essence, there is no strict limit on the number of different metals that can be mixed into an alloy. However, practical factors do impose limitations. When metals are combined, they form an alloy that may have unique properties, such as better strength, resistance to corrosion, or lighter weight. Think of it as making a new flavor of ice cream by mixing various ingredients. The more metals you mix, though, the more complicated the interactions become. Some metals might not blend well, or they might create undesirable attributes. This is similar to adding too many toppings to your ice cream; it might not taste as good or have a strange texture. So while it's theoretically possible to mix many metals, practical reasons usually keep the number of metals in an alloy to a handful.

The difference between melting and burning depends on the object's chemical makeup and how it reacts to heat. Melting is a physical change where a solid becomes a liquid when heated, like ice turning to water. Burning, on the other hand, is a chemical change as the object reacts with oxygen, producing fire and releasing energy. For example, when wood is heated, it catches fire and burns, while an ice cube melts and turns into a liquid.	"It depends solely on whether the ""combustion"" reaction for that material needs more energy than the phase change (solid>liquid), or not. If it needs more energy than the object would need to melt, it will melt *first*. If it needs less than object would need to melt, it will burn. Please note, however, that everything can burn, if heated ~~wrong~~ fast enough. Iron normally would melt, for instance, but can be set on fire nonetheless."
225	336397f1-5645-48ad-8f9f-54a1dbebbc70.txt	What does carbon monoxide do? Like what is its purpose of existing?	Carbon monoxide (co) is a colorless, odorless, and toxic gas that is produced as a by-product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. Its main purpose is not intentionally harmful; it exists as a result of natural and human-made processes, but it can be dangerous when inhaled in high levels. To put it simply, carbon monoxide is formed when there's not enough oxygen available for a complete combustion of a carbon-based fuel like gasoline, wood, or coal. This can happen in various situations, such as automobile engines, household furnaces, or fireplaces that don't have proper ventilation. When inhaled, carbon monoxide interferes with our body's ability to transport and utilize oxygen. Our red blood cells contain a molecule called hemoglobin, which is responsible for transporting oxygen from our lungs to other parts of our body. However, carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity (attraction) to hemoglobin than oxygen does. When co is present in the air we breathe, it competes with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin, and it usually wins. As a result, our blood can't deliver sufficient oxygen to our cells, leading to a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia can cause headache, confusion, dizziness, fatigue, and ultimately, in severe cases, unconsciousness or even death. Thus, the real danger of carbon monoxide is that it's hard for us to detect (since it's colorless and odorless) and can silently cause harm when our body's oxygen transport system is disrupted. To prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, it's important to maintain and periodically check appliances that produce co (like furnaces), ensure proper ventilation in areas where combustion occurs, and use co detectors in your home.	There is no purpose, it's just a natural by-product of combustion with fuels that contain carbon (which is most of them). Combustion is when oxygen binds to atoms, which creates a very strong bond. That creation of a strong bond releases energy. Most of the time, one carbon atom will bind with two oxygen atoms to make carbon dioxide. Sometimes, though, only one oxygen atom and one carbon atom meet, creating carbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide is very non-reactive. The oxygen atoms are bound tightly to the carbon atom, and there are no free electrons to grab onto another atom. Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, *does* have some free electrons on the carbon where another atom of molecule would bind to it as carbon dioxide. When carbon monoxide gets into your body, it sticks to the iron atoms inside your hemoglobin proteins which carry oxygen around through your blood. With the carbon monoxide in the way, that hemoglobin can't hold any oxygen. Since hemoglobin is built to hold onto and let go of o2 molecules, your body doesn't have any good tools to get rid of carbon monoxide. The side that's facing away from the hemoglobin is the oxygen atom, which is still bound tightly to the carbon, so nothing else can really grab onto that oxygen atom to pull the carbon monoxide off. That means carbon monoxide tends to stick to your hemoglobin much longer than oxygen would, so it stays in your blood from carrying oxygen for a long time. Since your blood can't carry oxygen as well as it needs to with the carbon monoxide in the way, your cells slowly suffocate and die.

Chewable medicine is designed to be broken down in the mouth before swallowing, while swallow-only pills are meant to dissolve in the stomach. Swallow-only pills often have a protective coating that helps control the release of the medicine, making it more effective. Chewing swallow-only pills can break this coating, potentially causing the medicine to release too quickly or be less effective. Always follow the instructions on the label for the best results.	Some pills are actually little machines that slowly dispense the medicine. Do *not* chew them. Others are slow dissolve to have a timed release of the medicine. Don't chew them either.

227	db2e6dbf-009a-4de0-89a0-567969814df7.txt	Why it can be too cold to start a fire I was scrolling through Youtube shorts and stumbled across [this scishow short](https://Youtube.com/shorts/fcv6a5jywa8? Feature=share) from hank explaining how it can literally be too cold to start a fire.	When it's too cold, starting a fire becomes challenging due to the difficulty in generating enough heat for the required chemical reaction. In a nutshell, the colder the environment, the harder it is to produce sufficient heat to start and maintain a fire. Fire is a chemical reaction called combustion, which needs three main components: fuel, heat, and oxygen. At low temperatures, heat is lost more rapidly to the surroundings, making it difficult to reach the required heat level. Think of trying to boil water in a pot with a hole - the heat keeps escaping, so it never reaches the boiling point. Moreover, some materials become less flammable or harder to ignite at low temperatures due to changes in their physical properties. For example, wood contains moisture, which freezes when it's cold, making it less combustible. So, in extremely cold conditions, it's harder to generate enough heat for the combustion process to occur and keep the fire going, even if you have fuel and oxygen.	Fire needs three things: heat, fuel, and air/oxygen. That’s because the chemical reaction for combustion needs three things: energy, a “reducer” and an oxidizer. If the fuel/oxygen mixture isn’t hot enough, it won’t ignite; think about gasoline vapors when you fill up a car. The fuel (gasoline vapor) and oxygen (air) are mixed, but it’s not hot enough to ignite. Usually an open flame (a lit wick or match) or a spark are hot enough to ignite the fuel. However, if the air is extremely cold, it’s possible that the air pulls away heat faster than the reaction can generate it. Therefore, the fire will go out; think about blowing out a match. You’re putting **more** oxygen into the fire; that’ll just make it worse! Except you’re taking away heat at the same time; if you take away heat faster than the additional oxygen can burn with the fuel, the fire will go out.

The extra oxygen molecule in hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) makes it more reactive than water (h2o) due to its unstable chemical structure. In h2o2, the two oxygen atoms are bonded in a way that creates tension, making them eager to break free. This instability allows them to easily react with other substances, often resulting in a release of energy and breaking down the substance it comes into contact with, including organic matter like cells, which is why it's caustic. In contrast, water has a stable structure where the atoms are content and less likely to react, making it a safe and vital substance for life.	H2o is a nice stable chemical. It's very happy being h20. If you shove an extra oxygen atom on to it, it doesn't like that. It wants to get rid of the extra oxygen atom and go back to being h2o. Because it wants to get rid of the oxygen atom, if it comes into contact with a chemical that can accept a new oxygen atom, it will probably pass the oxygen atom across. This will change the other chemical. If the other chemical is part of your skin, that will hurt.

The main idea: the couch does not have added flame retardants, but it still contains a chemical that is listed as a concern by prop 65. Your couch does not contain added flame retardant chemicals, meaning no extra chemicals were used to reduce the risk of fire. However, tdcpp, which is a flame retardant, is still present possibly because it's a part of the materials used to make the couch. Prop 65 is a California law that requires companies to inform consumers about the presence of specific chemicals that may have harmful effects. It's important to know that the presence of tdcpp doesn't automatically mean severe risk, but it's good to be aware and take precautions like airing out your couch and washing your hands after handling it.	Here's the thing with prop 65. . It requires companies to test their product to see if they can cause cancer in measurable quantities, and if they can put a warning.

Atomic mass is the total mass of an element's protons, neutrons, and electrons, expressed in atomic mass units (amu). Molar mass is the mass of one mole (6. 022 x 10^23 atoms) of an element, in grams. Since 1 amu is approximately the same mass as one proton or neutron, and there are equal numbers of protons and neutrons in a mole, their numeric values match, even though the units differ (amu vs grams	Because we defined one mole of protons to be the number of particles that weighs 1 gram (basically. . . There's some nuance to that). And protons and neutrons weight essentially the same thing, so the atomic mass (# of protons an neutrons) will be the mass of 1 mole of the thing. Electrons do have some weight but it's so tiny that it doesn't really make a difference.

These sweeteners, such as aspartame or sucralose, provide the sweet taste without adding calories, as our bodies don't metabolize them for energy. Additionally, some drinks contain minimal ingredients like flavored water with trace amounts of natural flavoring, resulting in an insignificant calorie count that's considered to be zero. So, it's the replacement or absence of high-calorie components that makes a beverage calorie-free.

I am currently being told they're completely different, even though they're both amphetamines with a similar side effect profile and potential for abuse. So what's the difference?	The main difference between methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall lies in their chemical structure, potency, and effects on the body. Both substances are stimulants that affect the central nervous system, but their specific properties and uses can vary due to these differences. Methamphetamine, commonly known as meth, is a highly potent and illegal drug. Its chemical structure is unique because it has an extra methyl group (ch3) attached to it. This small change makes methamphetamine more potent than regular amphetamines, as it allows the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily. This results in stronger and longer-lasting effects on the user. Amphetamines, like those found in adderall, are a class of drugs often used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and narcolepsy. Adderall is a combination of amphetamine salts and is available through prescription. Although it has a similar effect on the central nervous system as methamphetamine, it is less potent and generally considered safer when used according to a doctor's prescription. Think of the relationship between methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall as similar to the difference between a strong cup of coffee and an espresso shot. Both contain caffeine and have stimulating effects, but the espresso is much more concentrated and potent. In summary, while both methamphetamine and amphetamines like adderall are related stimulants, they differ in their chemical structure, potency, and uses. Methamphetamine is a more powerful and dangerous substance, while adderall is a prescription medication used to treat specific medical conditions and is considered safer when used as directed.	Lots of chemicals have relationships like this. A glass of 10% ethanol - 2 carbons and a hydroxide (oh) - will at best make you slightly intoxicated, that's a strong beer or weak wine. Cut off one of those carbons and you have methanol, now that glass will render you hospitalized and permanently blind at best, more likely dead. Despite being structurally similar, there are plenty of differences between an adderall pill and a typical meth dose. First, you take more meth, typically from 100mg (twice my daily ritalin intake) up to 500mg for impure stuff/high tolerance. Second, an adderall pill isn't pure, not even close. They're mostly fillers, stuff to pad it out and slow the absorption so you don't get so much of a rush and short peak, it's absorbed over maybe half an hour into the bloodstream then starts working. But you don't have the delay with meth, you either snort it where its rapidly absorbed almost right away, smoke it where it's absorbed into the lungs then pumped basically right to your brain, or inject it directly to the blood. There's no build up, just an instant rush. Much like the difference between smoking a joint and eating brownies, one takes way longer. I'm sure if you had access to pure, crystalline versions of the amphetamines in adderall, and you smoked/snorted it, you'd be pretty well messed up but medicine is all about taking powerful chemicals and packaging them in ways that allow your body to use them.

"Viruses are not big enough to exhibit the complexity of a living organism. They can be compared to individual structures that exist inside a cell. Nevertheless, they can be physically destroyed like all things. You can apply a solvent to make its shell fall apart. Killing means making something stop functioning. You can ""kill"" a project or a running computer program."	"Viruses can be ""killed"" or rendered inactive through various methods such as heat, uv light, or chemicals like disinfectants. Over time, their protective protein coat can break down on surfaces, making them unable to infect cells. Your analogy of viruses being like complex bits of code is accurate; they need to enter a cell to ""execute"" their program and replicate."

When water is poured on a grease fire, it instantly turns into steam due to the fire's high temperature. This rapid expansion of water into steam causes the grease to splatter and spread, making the fire bigger. Additionally, water is denser than oil, causing it to sink and pushing the flaming grease to the surface, worsening the fire.	1. Water and oil don't mix. 2. Water is heavier than oil, so it sinks to the bottom. 3. Oil burns at a much higher temperature than water's boiling temperature. So the water sinks, quickly boils, which causes it to turns to steam, which bubbles upwards, throwing all the burning oil up in the air.

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, absorbs odors due to its ability to neutralize acidic and basic (alkaline) molecules present in the air. It doesn't necessarily attract odor molecules, but rather interacts with them to neutralize the chemicals causing the smell. Many unpleasant odors are caused by volatile organic compounds (vocs) and other acidic or basic particles in the air. When these particles come into contact with baking soda, a chemical reaction occurs, resulting in the production of more neutral and less smelly compounds. Baking soda's structure can also be described as somewhat porous. It is crystalline in nature and forms a loose, powdery texture. This texture increases the surface area of the baking soda, making it easier for the odor particles to interact with it, allowing more opportunities for the chemical reactions to occur. Picture baking soda like a simple air filter. As air flows through the filter, the odor particles in the air come into contact with the baking soda, which neutralizes them. The result is cleaner-smelling air. While baking soda may not eliminate all odors, it is an excellent option for many household applications due to its gentle, non-toxic nature and low cost.	It doesn't really absorb odors, that was a commercial stunt by arm and hammer. Also the other comment saying that odors are acidic is plain wrong, you have all kind of smelly molecules. Acetic acid from vinegar is acidic. Methyl,ethyl amines found in fish are basic. Benzene or toluene are neither. Where baking soda seems to work a little bit, it is with thiols like the ones found in amaryliddacea like garlic or onion (but also in skunks). And it may be simply an adsorption process. We are sensitive to really small concentrations of those compounds so they are not hard to remove. It is actually a bit more efficient to make a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda for those. Note that for the skunk smell it is usually not sufficient because the concentrations are really high and it tends to bind strongly to skin and clothes that would get damaged by the higher peroxide concentration that would be needed.

Looking for some basic explanation or chemistry here. Mek usually eats all gooey stuff but dried spray adhesive it will not. Floor paste wax eats the spray adhesive like no buddies business/little effort. How is this possible?	"Wax is nonpolar. All the other solvents you listed have varying degrees of polarity - the alcohols being the most polar, followed by acetone, then methyl ethyl ketone. When it comes to dissolution, the rule is ""like dissolves like"" - the solvent with the most similar polarity to the solute dissolves it the easiest. Since the dried spray adhesive is likely nonpolar, wax is the best solvent in this scenario. For the record, cooking oil would probably work too."	Floor paste wax dissolves dried spray adhesive because it contains solvents that dissolve the adhesive's polymer chains. While mek, acetone, and denatured alcohol are powerful solvents, they may not effectively break down spray adhesive due to the adhesive's chemical composition. Floor paste wax, on the other hand, is specifically designed to remove various kinds of dirt and residues, making it more effective at dissolving the adhesive as it targets a wider range of substances.

When bleach comes into contact with colored fabric, it causes a chemical reaction that breaks down the color molecules, resulting in a change in color. In the case of your grey pants turning orange, the reason for this color change has to do with the underlying pigments present in the original dye and how they react with bleach. Fabrics are colored using various dyes, which are composed of different color molecules (pigments). These pigments absorb and reflect light in specific ways, which is what gives the fabric its color. Grey, a neutral color, is usually created by combining a mixture of black and white pigments or complementary colors like red and green or blue and orange. When you spilled bleach on your grey pants, the bleach reacted with the color pigments in the fabric, breaking down some of the molecules and causing the color to change. Specifically, the bleach most likely affected the darker (black) pigments, causing them to break down more so than the lighter pigments. As a result, the underlying color pigments become more prominent. In the case of your pants, the remaining color molecules that were not as affected by the bleach were most likely those responsible for the orange hue you observed. It could be that the original grey color of the pants was made by combining orange and blue pigments, and the bleach reacted more with the blue pigments, leaving behind the orange ones. In conclusion, the reason your grey pants turned orange after being exposed to bleach is due to the chemical reaction between the bleach and the color pigments in the fabric, breaking down some pigments while leaving others more visible, and revealing the underlying orange hue in this case.	Light is made of different wavelengths that we detect as different colors. Going from long wavelength to short wavelength we have roygbiv (red orange yellow green blue indigo violet). Things that are colored absorb some wavelengths and reflect others. For example, an orange thing absorbs rygbiv but reflects orange. A green thing absorbs roybiv but reflects green. Black (and grey) things absorb all wavelengths of visible light; white things don't absorb any of the wavelengths. We use colored things that bind to fabrics as dyes. At the chemical level, the dyes that absorb long wavelengths have longer regions of what are called conjugated bonds. I'm not sure what an eli5 synonym for 'conjugated bonds' is, but it doesn't actually matter if you know what a conjugated bond is to understand this. Things that absorb shorter wavelengths have shorter lengths of these chemical bonds. The bleach acts on some of the conjugated bonds, which are present in the longest stretches in red dyes, (long stretch = big target vs little target) thus red dyes are more likely be affected..... making the pants look orangey-brown. Some shorter stretches of the red dyes might remain and still absorb shorter wavelengths. The same thing happens when dark-haired people bleach their hair - at first it turns orange. Successive treatments with bleach will make it lighter and lighter. A little off-topic, but people do what you have done intentionally (bc obv it looks cool) in a process called reverse tie dye. It is a lot like tie dye, but you fold/wrap/tie the fabric to limit the penetration of the bleach.
238	6e6fff54-272c-4ca8-b18a-636339acad6e.txt	How does paracetamol work?	Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a common pain reliever and fever reducer that works by affecting the way our body perceives pain and regulates temperature. To understand how it works, let's first talk about some chemicals in our body called prostaglandins. These chemicals are released when we have an injury or illness, and they can increase pain and inflammation as well as trigger fever as a response to infection. Paracetamol works by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (cox), which is involved in the production of prostaglandins. When you take paracetamol, it decreases the amount of prostaglandins produced in the body, leading to a reduced feeling of pain and a decrease in fever. However, paracetamol is not as effective in reducing inflammation as some other pain relievers, like ibuprofen, which is why it's often preferred for treating headaches, fever, and minor aches and pains. It's important to note that the exact mechanism of how paracetamol reduces pain and fever is not fully understood, and researchers are still studying the details. Additionally, paracetamol's effect on cox enzymes seems to primarily occur in the brain, which is why it can effectively reduce pain and fever without significantly affecting inflammation in the rest of the	We don’t know exactly yet. Regarding other painkillers like ibuprofen/naproxene/asprine/metamizol (so called nsaid/nsar), they all influence one of your bodies enzymes (as you requested an eli5: a tiny chemical tool that will produce or modify something), called cyclooxigenase (cox). This enzyme produces substances that will cause fever, pain etc. Because these symptoms are a warning sign to your body that something is wrong. A really basic explanation lacking many things: nsars will reduce the activity of cox and therefore will inhibit the production of substances that cause fever, pain etc. . Paracetamol however, is different. There are multiple theories, but the one that’s taught in medical school mostly is, that paracetamol modifies the way your brain will perceive pain. Eli5: your brain will think about pain as less terrible and less alarming when it’s under the influence of paracetamol, either because the pain information is received less & later and/or the understand of „pain“ is changed. Btw: changing the perception of pain is the major effect of all opioids. They are several magnitudes more efficient then paracetamol but also far more dangerous.
239	8672a27e-ff6c-487e-88af-9a4d69a6d44f.txt	Why is it so difficult to discover / make new elements? Since element numbers are based on protons, why can't they just add more to discover element 119, 120, etc?	The difficulty in discovering and creating new elements mainly lies in their instability and the challenges faced during their production process. Elements are determined by the number of protons in their nucleus, with each element having a unique number of protons. As we move up the periodic table, elements have more protons and, consequently, an increased number of neutrons to help hold the nucleus together. However, the forces holding a large nucleus together become weaker as it grows in size. This is due to the fact that, inside the nucleus, two competing forces are at play: the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons together, and the electromagnetic force, which causes repulsion between protons. While the strong nuclear force has a powerful but limited range, the electromagnetic force has a weaker but much longer range. In bigger nuclei, this results in an unstable balance between these forces. In addition to the instability, the production process for creating new elements is challenging. New elements are generally created by smashing atoms together at extremely high speeds using particle accelerators. This process requires precise conditions and immense amount of energy, and even under such circumstances, the resulting elements often exist for just fractions of a second before decaying into more stable, lighter elements, making them difficult to study or produce in practical quantities.	"The atoms become very unstable and hard to detect. It isnt as simple as adding a proton. You need to force them to. Then when they do, they exist for a split millisecond and decay into something else. So you need to detect it in that split second of existence. Every number you go up requires elements that are more and more unstable and hard to make. So it gets very expensive and very tedious just to have the materials. Then you need a giant collider device running 24 7 for months at a time hoping that eventually a new element forms and that when it does, your machine can detect it in the split second it exists. Then you need to proce it actually existed. It really isnt that easy to explain just via text and basic wording. There was a good video put out on this recently called ""the man who tried to fake an element"". They go through the element discovery race that took place through the 70s-90s and explain the process of the whole thing and why it isnt that easy and why it has reached the point of not really being doable."

Medicine and multivitamins target specific parts of the body by being designed with certain chemical properties that interact with specific molecules or cells in the targeted area. Once consumed, they travel throughout the body via the bloodstream. Their unique properties allow them to either be attracted toward or act only in specific areas where they're needed. For example, certain pain relievers target inflammation by blocking specific enzymes involved in the inflammation process.	"They cannot target a specific part of the body. However, if you have some sort of deficiency that shows up most prominently in a specific part of the body, then taking the multivitamin or supplement can reduce the deficiency and ""heal"" the affected part simply because that's the part that hurts. Same for painkillers; they dull the pain everywhere, but you only notice the effect where you were feeling pain."

"Capsaicin in spicy foods tricks your brain into thinking it's experiencing heat, which triggers a response like sweating or producing extra mucus. This increased mucus production causes dried snot to soften and ""melt,"" helping to clear your sinuses. It's not the actual heat, but the body's reaction to the perceived heat that causes this effect."	Dried snot does not “melt” when you eat spicy food. Your mucous membrane produces more mucous, which then hydrates any dried mucous still clinging to the hairs in your nose as well. The reason you produce more mucous is because spicy good stimulates the trigeminal sensory nerve. It causes your nose to run.

In a nutshell, while introducing oxygen and good bacteria into garbage dumps could aid decomposition, the process is not as simple or efficient as it may seem due to various factors such as cost, feasibility, and environmental concerns. One reason waste managers don't bore columns and pump in oxygen is the cost associated with the process. Installing and maintaining such a system would be expensive, considering the vast size and depth of landfill sites. Additionally, different types of waste decompose at different rates, making it difficult to optimize oxygen levels and bacteria introduction across the entire landfill. Another concern is the potential release of greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide during the decomposition process. If not properly managed, these gases could contribute to air pollution and climate change. Oxygen introduction may increase the emission of these gases, requiring additional equipment to capture and manage these emissions. Lastly, the feasibility of introducing oxygen and bacteria in a controlled manner in a densely packed landfill is questionable. Waste is compacted and covered with soil, which may act as a barrier to the even distribution of oxygen and bacteria within the landfill. For these reasons, other waste management strategies such as recycling and composting are preferred to improve the decomposition process.	A lot of facilities have started doing this. But it is not as simple as just blowing air into the ground. There is a big risk of fire at these facilities, even the heat from the microbes can start fires and once a fire start it is very hard to extinguish under ground. Adding to this you would get a lot of smell from the decomposition if you do not have enough oxygen, which they almost never have. And they need to reduce the amount of smell and even toxic gasses that gets released. There is also a big problem in that a lot of trash do not allow air to flow through it. So if you blow air down in one part of the landfill it may not get to all areas. So it is a very technical and expensive operation to make sure you get a nice controllable amount of air into the landfill without any of the issues with this.

Yes, both detergents and soaps are designed to remove dirt, but they work differently due to their chemical composition and how they interact with water and dirt particles. Soaps are made from natural materials, like animal fats or plant oils, combined with an alkaline substance, like sodium hydroxide (lye). They work by reducing water's surface tension. In simpler terms, soap molecules have one end that likes water (hydrophilic) and another end that dislikes water but likes oil and grease (hydrophobic). When soap and water mix, the hydrophobic ends surround the dirt and grease, forming tiny droplets called micelles. These micelles get suspended in water and can be easily rinsed away. Detergents, on the other hand, are synthetic (man-made) and work in a similar way but with some differences. They also have hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends, but they can work effectively in a broader range of water types, including hard water containing minerals like calcium or magnesium. Hard water can make soap less effective since minerals in it can bind with soap molecules, resulting in a sticky residue. So while both soaps and detergents achieve the same goal of cleaning, they do it through slightly different methods, with detergents generally	This is sorta like adhesives. Sticky things are sticky, but once you realize exactly what goes on on a molecular level, you can specially formulate adhesives that are really really good at sticking to wood. This might or might not make them really good at sticking to metals or plastics because they have a different molecular structure. And so you can end up with some general purpose adhesives and some hyper specific adhesives detergents use man-made chemicals so they can be tuned to particular jobs. Besides the fact that not all cleaning jobs involve dirt, dirt itself is not just one type of substance. In a bathroom, water marks and calcification from hard water are often a target. In a kitchen, oil and grease. In a carpet, dust and dirt probably trod in from outside, heavier particles. On elevated surfaces you get dust from shedding skin and airborne, lighter particles. These are all subtly different and if you know the molecular structure, then you can design chemicals to specifically help in cleaning those particles.

Co2 is used to pressurize drinks because it easily dissolves in water, creating carbonic acid, which gives beverages their characteristic fizziness. Nitrogen doesn't dissolve in water as readily and wouldn't produce the same fizzy effect. Using atmospheric air could introduce undesirable gases, like oxygen, which might affect flavor and freshness. Additionally, co2 is a byproduct of fermentation, which is part of the natural process in making some beverages like beer and champagne.	Carbonated water creates carbonic acid which gives a little sting and sourness to your drink and tickles your nose when the bubbles burst at the top. Nitrogen infusion gives a creamy texture and it's used in beer and coffee. Oxygenated water is advertised as having health benefits, but at high amounts of infusion you start getting hydrogen peroxide, with is not good to drink. Just using regular air is basically nitrogen and oxygen.

Hormone pills/medications are synthetically made chemicals that mimic the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are created in laboratories by replicating the molecular structure of the natural hormones, which allows them to perform similar functions.

What makes it react if the sample itself is negative and how does that prove the test is working?"	The control line in a diagnostic test, like a pregnancy test, serves as an indicator that the test is functioning properly. It works using a process called lateral flow, which relies on capillary action to move the sample (like urine) across the test strip. As the sample moves, it encounters various chemical substances that react to specific molecules, producing the lines on the test. The control line contains antibodies that bind to a colored substance included in the test strip. Regardless of whether the sample is positive or negative, the colored substance will always pass through the control line area. If the control line doesn't appear, it means the test might be faulty (e.g. , insufficient sample, an expired test, or other issues). In summary, the control line ensures that the sample has been properly applied, the test chemicals are working as intended, and the result of the test can be trusted.	The control line is basically testing for the test ingredient. Say the test is looking for some hormone a. It has a supply of substrate b, which is known/designed to react with hormone a to form product c. Now if you test only for product c and find nothing, do you know if there was no hormone a? Maybe the substrate b degraded and is no longer sensitive to hormone a, so no product c was formed. So if you have two tests in one, one to test for product c and one to test for substrate b, then you can be sure that the lack of product c wasn’t because substrate b was missing, but because hormone a was missing, since the substrate b test came back positive. This means you’re not producing hormone a (ie, you’re not pregnant).

This characteristic is mainly due to the molecular structure of the substance. Molecules are made up of atoms, with each atom having a positive or negative charge. Water molecules are polar, meaning they have both positive and negative charges. Hydrophobic substances, however, typically have nonpolar molecules, which means their charges are more evenly distributed. The key to hydrophobicity is that like attracts like. Polar substances, like water, will stick together, while nonpolar substances will stick to other nonpolar substances. In the case of hydrophobic materials, their nonpolar nature causes them to repel water, as the water molecules would rather stick to each other than mix with the	Water's main property is that the side with the hydrogens is slightly positively charged, while the side that is mostly oxygen is slightly negatively charged. This let's water stick to itself, the way a magnet sticks to other magnets. Hydrophobic materials are just ones that *don't* have any preferred charge at any side. This is usually long chain molecules, because short molecules are very often at least a little charged. You could imagine it as a piece of lead in a sea of magnets. It's not that water is specifically repelled from them, just that water attracts more to everything else, including other water.

"Stainless steel is a type of steel that has at least 10. 5% chromium added to it. This chromium forms a protective layer of chromium oxide on the steel's surface, which prevents rust and corrosion. The more chromium added, the stronger the corrosion resistance. Regular steel, on the other hand, lacks this protective layer, allowing it to rust and corrode over time. In summary, stainless steel is ""stainless"" because of the added chromium that creates a protective layer, making it more resistant to rust and corrosion than regular steel."	Stainless steel is an alloy of iron with a lot of chromium and nickel added in. The chromium corrodes quickly in air, to form a layer of chromium oxide. The chromium oxide is very tough and a thin, invisible layer seals the surface of the metal off, so no more air can get in. Regular iron corrodes to form iron oxide, which is rust. However, rust doesn't seal the surface, so air and water can get penetrate the rust and get to the metal underneath causing further corrosion and more rusting.

However, plumbers often dislike using drano for several reasons. First, drano can be harmful to the environment and the user. The chemicals in drano, like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, can cause skin irritations and are hazardous if ingested or inhaled. When mixed with water, these chemicals create heat, which can lead to burns and damage to surfaces. Additionally, chemical drain cleaners can contaminate waterways and harm aquatic life when it eventually gets washed away. Second, drano can potentially damage pipes, especially if used repeatedly or improperly. The heat produced by drano's chemical reaction can cause pvc pipes to weaken over time, and the corrosive chemicals can damage older, corroded pipes made of metal. Drano may also not entirely dissolve certain materials, forming a sludge-like substance that can be difficult to clean up. This leads to further buildup in pipes, and plumbers are often left dealing with the mess. Lastly, drano is often seen as a temporary solution to clogged pipes. While it may provide short-term relief, it doesn't address the root cause of the clog, such as improper disposal of cooking grease or a broken pipe. Plumbers prefer to determine and fix the underlying issue, rather than continuously using a chemical that could cause more harm than good in the long run.	They only encounter it when it doesn't work; and it's a hazardous chemical that makes their job harder. If your sink drain is blocked up, here are some things that could happen:1. *you just call the plumber. *2. You try plunging it with a sink plunger; that works. You don't call the plumber. 3. You try plunging it, but that doesn't work. *you call the plumber. *4. You put drain cleaner down it, and it works. You don't call the plumber. 5. You put drain cleaner down it, and it doesn't work. *you call the plumber. *the plumber only sees cases #1, #3, and #5. They don't see the cases #2 and #4 where you were able to unblock your sink yourself. The plumber's opinions come from the cases they see:* case #1 is usually a really easy fix. * case #3 is less easy (because the clog is bad enough the plunger didn't work) but still okay. * case #5 is now a sink drain full of nasty chemicals that want to eat organic matter (including plumbers' skin). So from the plumber's perspective, they'd rather you didn't use drain cleaner. They never see the upside of it (case #4), so for them it's always the absolute worst.

As far as I know, access to uranium is tightly controlled for obvious reasons, but hydrogen is everywhere, and even getting access to deuterium shouldn't be too hard.	Nuclear bombs that rely solely on hydrogen without uranium are not possible because the fusion process requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to initiate, which can only be achieved using a fission reaction from radioactive materials like uranium or plutonium. Nuclear fusion, the process at the core of a hydrogen bomb, involves combining lighter elements like hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium) to form heavier elements (like helium) and release a tremendous amount of energy. To create these conditions, a triggering mechanism is needed, which is provided by a fission bomb. A fission bomb uses uranium or plutonium to create a self-sustained chain reaction that releases a massive amount of energy in the form of an explosion. This explosion generates the intense heat and pressure required to initiate the fusion process in a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb. While it's true that achieving fusion on a small scale, such as in labs, is possible, the energy output from these experiments is often much less than the energy input required to initiate the process, making it impractical for use in a weapon. In contrast, nuclear bombs need to be self-sustained, compact, and highly destructive, which requires the combination of fission and fusion reactions to be effective. Therefore, without the initial fission reaction from materials like uranium or plutonium, it would be impossible to create the necessary conditions for a purely fusion-based thermonuclear weapon.	> people demonstrate achieving fusion all the time. I mean, not *all* the time. It takes a lot of equipment and power to create fusion, much less get a net energy gain out of it. If you aren't in a massive test reactor you aren't going to be demonstrating fusion. > when building a bomb, we don't really care about useful energy; we just want to release a lot of it. We actually do care about useful energy since the aim is to make the fusion reaction release more energy than it took to start. Otherwise we would just use whatever we used to start the reaction alone as the explosive. And therein lies the problem: starting fusion is hard. It requires immense temperatures and pressures which you aren't going to get out of conventional explosives. You can't just have a fuse leading to deuterium and while hydrogen will burn violently when exposed to oxygen it isn't nearly as powerful as conventional chemical explosives. Even carefully shaped charges using our most powerful conventional chemical explosives aren't going to fuse the material of a warhead. Instead what we need is the power of a fission bomb to provide the heat and pressure to make the fusion fuel actually fuse and release even more energy.

Heat build-up in spicy foods is due to the presence of compounds called capsaicinoids, which are responsible for the sensation of spiciness. The way these compounds interact with our taste buds and sensory receptors determines whether the heat builds up or stays consistent. When you eat spicy foods, capsaicinoids activate a protein called trpv1 on the sensory receptors in your mouth and tongue. This protein responds to high temperatures and pain, sending signals to your brain that you're experiencing heat or discomfort. The more capsaicinoids present in the food, the stronger the sensation of spiciness. Some spicy foods cause heat build-up because the capsaicinoids take a while to bind to the trpv1 receptors, allowing the heat to accumulate gradually. Also, our saliva and the process of digestion can release more of these compounds as we eat, making the spiciness seem to grow over time. An example of this is spicy curry, where the heat intensifies as you continue to eat. On the other hand, some spicy foods have a consistent heat level due to the capsaicinoids binding quickly to the trpv1 receptors, providing an immediate and constant sensation of spiciness. An example is hot sauce, which has a more stable heat level when consumed. These factors contribute to the different experiences of spiciness in various foods.	It has to do with how fast your tongue/mouth can clear the spice. When I make a hot sauce with 0 oils, it hit hard ands fast and drops off hard and fast. For instance, my scott bonnet. I roast them to dry and concentrate the capsaicin to make them even more spicy. Scotch bonnet rank in at 100,000-350,000 scu. Then I make my szechuan sauce make with the same named pepper. Its scu is 50,000-75,000. When I make something with this sauce, every bite just get hotter than the previous one and I got to wait like 10 minutes or so for the heat to go down. This sauce uses oil in it. The difference between the 2, oil, lipids. The lipids don't get washed away with just water in your mouth and your saliva and everything your body makes is water based. Capsaicin is lipid soluble. So you got a layer of oil on your mouth with capsaicin that you can't swallow or wash away and then you add more to it and more to it and more to it. You drink a fatty liquid like milk, it will then finally wash some of that capsaicin down.

I saw a news article that said that time crystals were found in some child's toy and that was the first time they have been found naturally occurring, and that was a breakthrough. I tried but failed to understand all the descriptions of time crystals I searched.	A time crystal is a unique state of matter where atoms organize and move in a repeating pattern over time without using energy. Imagine a row of dominoes falling and standing back up infinitely without needing a push. It's exciting because it defies the laws of physics, and the recent discovery in a child's toy showed they can occur naturally. Time crystals could have potential applications in quantum computing.	A typical crystal is just something with a molecular pattern that repeats itself. Each atom in the structure follows roughly the same pattern as those around it. The pattern is repeated in space. A time crystal is a quantum system whose pattern repeats in time instead of in space. Instead of the atoms being physically arranged in a way that repeats, the atoms change their spin in cyclic patterns.

Natural flavors come from real food sources, while artificial flavors are man-made in laboratories. Although natural flavors may go through processing, they originate from natural ingredients like fruits or spices. In contrast, artificial flavors are created by combining chemicals to mimic certain flavors. Despite this difference, the two may sometimes be chemically identical, but their sources make them distinct.	"Marketing and regulations around marketing, more or less. Legally, the division is around whether the compound occurs naturally in a plant or animal. If it does, it can be called natural flavoring. In either case it must be extracted, processed, and put into the food. The division between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" flavors is mostly meaningless beyond these regulatory requirements around naming."

The inside of a lindor truffle feels cold because of its smooth, high fat content, and the way it melts on your tongue. The main idea is that the cold sensation is actually due to the truffle's melting process, which absorbs heat from your mouth. When you put the truffle in your mouth and it starts to melt, it needs to absorb heat from its surroundings to change from a solid to a liquid. Your mouth provides this heat, which makes the truffle feel cold as it melts. Higher fat content melts more quickly, making the sensation more pronounced. Similarly, the smooth texture of the truffle further increases the surface area that gets in contact with your tongue, thus making the cold sensation even stronger. So, the combination of high fat content and smooth texture creates the unique cooling sensation inside a lindor truffle.	"It's at room temperature, assuming you don't store it in the fridge or left it in the sun. But compared to the inside of your mouth, room temperature *is* rather cold. What makes this kind of chocolate (alos known as ""[eiskonfekt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ischoklad)"" in German) feel colder than normal sweets is their heat capacity. They melt right around room temperature, which means they *stay* at that temperature until a significant amount of heat from your mouth is transferred into them to melt them. Melting something generally takes a huge amount of energy compared to just heating it, so your mouth cools down more. In essence, the filling is a 25c-ish ""ice cube"". It feels colder the same way as keeping an ice cube in your mouth feels colder than just drinking an ice-cold drink."

"Nuclear fusion is a process where light atomic nuclei, like hydrogen, combine to form heavier nuclei, such as helium, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. This is different from nuclear fission, which involves splitting heavy nuclei like uranium. Think of fusion like building a sandcastle. When you combine (or fuse) small amounts of sand together, you create a bigger structure and release some energy at the same time. The sun's energy, for example, comes from nuclear fusion occurring at its core. Now, let's talk about break-even fusion. The challenge in achieving nuclear fusion on earth is that it requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to ignite the reaction, like 15 million degrees celsius (27 million degrees fahrenheit). The term ""break-even fusion"" refers to the point at which the energy produced by nuclear fusion is equal to the energy put into initiating the reaction. In other words, it's when our metaphorical sandcastle construction becomes self-sufficient, producing energy without requiring any more input from us. Achieving break-even fusion is a major milestone in the development of fusion as a practical energy source."	Fusion is when two or more atoms are pushed together so hard their nuclei fuse together, creating a different element than the original atoms were. The version that is being done here on earth uses hydrogen atoms fusing together into helium atoms. When they fuse a metric crapload of energy is released. That energy can then be used in the same manner that energy from fission or chemical reactions can be used. The problem with fusion is that it takes a metric crapload of energy to push atoms together hard enough to get them to fuse. For this to be a useful energy source, it needs to take less energy to get the atoms to fuse than the fusion releases. The 'break even' point is where it takes the same amount of energy to fuse as the fusion releases. Going *past* the break-even point is where we get fusion that is useful for generating energy for us to use.

"Ethanol alcohol doesn't actually ""expire"" but loses its effectiveness as a sanitizer over time. This happens because ethanol is volatile and evaporates when exposed to air, reducing its concentration. As the concentration of ethanol decreases below 60-70%, it becomes less effective in killing germs. To maintain its sanitizing power, store ethanol-based sanitizers in airtight containers and away from heat sources."	The ethanol reacts with oxygen to form vinegar. That too is a sanitizer but a different kind which might cause acid burns when applied to skin and stain objects it is applied to. There are also other things in regular ethanol sanitizer to help it gel and moisturize skin, these ingredients may also turn bad over time.

The only ingredients on the label are “peanuts, salt. ” we keep peanuts unrefrigerated in the pantry… we keep salt unrefrigerated in the pantry… so how come when you mash them together it makes something that (according to the jar) must be refrigerated after opening?	"""good"" peanut butter needs refrigeration to prevent oil separation and spoilage. When peanuts are ground into butter, their oils are released, making it easier for bacteria to grow.

Regular peanut butter often has added stabilizers, enabling it to stay smooth and unrefrigerated."	“good” peanut butter is often “natural” peanut butter. As you note, the ingredient list doesn’t contain extra things that keep everything mixed together. So, as you notice, the good peanut butter separates.

If someone farts/poops, does it just immediately explode into billions of microscopic particles that engulf the area and get into people's noses? How is that not the most unhealthy and disgusting thing ever, to inhale people's intestinal solids? Same with cooking something? Like, if I had the superpower of being able to see microscopic stuff, I would just see a cloud of beef particles for a square half mile around the burger joint that always smells so good when I drive nearby it?"	Odors and smells are essentially tiny particles of substances called molecules that are released into the air from the source, like food or a fart. These molecules are so small and light that they can easily float around in the air, but they still have mass. When we smell something, these odor molecules travel to our nose and interact with our olfactory (smell) receptors, allowing us to detect the scent. In the fart example, it's not exactly solid particles from the intestines but rather gases and trace amounts of other compounds that create the odor. As for cooking, the heat causes food molecules to break down and release aromatic compounds into the air, leading to the delicious smells we perceive. So, if you had microscopic vision, you would indeed see countless tiny particles floating around and dispersing throughout the area surrounding the odor source.	"Anything that is matter has mass. A fart or a smell is just molecules like the oxygen or nitrogen in the air. In the case of farts, most of the gas (\~75%) is hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Those don't have much of a smell, but there's also usually a tiny bit (<1%) of sulphur-containing gases that stink terribly. They're gases, not poop dust, so particles might be a bit misleading in this context. We're not talking ""intestinal solids"". Farts range from 10 - 400 ml in volume, and the fart gas happens to weigh roughly 1 g/l, so a fart weights 10-400 mg. By comparison, a grain of rice weighs about 29 mg. Other smells are typically gases too. They are organic molecules that stick to proteins in our noses and stimulate nerves that our brain interprets as smells."

When crystals form the atoms get locked into a very precise arrangement (the actual shape is a complicated mess of how the electrons are configured, but it's very predictable). As a result, when an atom gets added to the crystal it can't just go anywhere, it needs to go to one of the spots that fits into the existing lattice. Forming a curve requires a nicely smooth changing direction and crystals don't have that. . . They have very specific planes where the atoms can be. Those planes form the faces of the crystal. And where two planes meet you get a line. . . A sharp edge.	Crystals form with sharp edges because their structure is based on a repeating pattern of molecules, called a crystal lattice. Think of it like building with lego blocks: when you stack them up, they create sharp edges and corners. The formation process involves molecules gradually arranging themselves into this pattern as the crystal grows. Since the pattern is repeating and has a specific shape, the edges and corners will naturally be sharp. Curved shapes would require a non-uniform or irregular arrangement of molecules, which isn't the case for crystals. The sharpness of crystals is simply due to their unique, ordered molecular structure.

The plastics that *are* recyclable can be melted down because when they are made, they don’t undergo a chemical change. They simply get melted, formed into a shape, and then cool/harden. (thermoplastic polymer)the plastics that *are not* recyclable *cannot* be melted down because when they are made they undergo a chemical reaction that causes them to hold their shape and harden. Once that chemical reaction has occurred, it can’t easily be reversed by simple reheating. (thermosetting polymer)	Not all plastics are recyclable because they have different chemical structures and melting points. When different types of plastics are melted together, they don't combine properly, leading to impurities and weak products. Unlike glass, which has a uniform composition, plastics require sorting and separating by type for effective recycling. Furthermore, some plastics degrade in quality when recycled, making them less desirable for reuse. Developing recycling methods for more plastics is an ongoing challenge for scientists and engineers.

In essence, plastics are made from crude oil or natural gas through a process called polymerization. Polymerization involves linking together small molecules, called monomers, into long chains, called polymers. These polymers are then used to create various types of plastics. For example, during the production of plastic, oil is first refined into substances called hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are then combined with different chemicals to create different types of plastic. Say, for making a plastic water bottle, the hydrocarbons are combined with chemicals like ethylene to create polyethylene, a common type of plastic. This variety of plastic types allows for countless everyday products to be made, such as bags, bottles, containers, and much more.	Latex can be harvested directly from trees, and still is, but most plastics used today are from petroleum. Simply put, plastics are chains of carbon+other stuff. Petroleum is very rich in carbon+other stuff. Refineries break down big chains of petroleum into smaller parts. They then combine these smaller parts into other big chains, which are the various types of plastic we use today. The same can be done with natural latex, but that stuff isn't as abundant so we don't use it much anymore. An analogy of this would be starting with a house. You break down the house into smaller parts: wood, nails, drywall, paint, and so on. You then use these parts to build a bunch of sheds.

Working out improves mental health by releasing endorphins, which are feel-good chemicals in the brain. These endorphins help reduce stress, anxiety, and even symptoms of ocd. Exercise also boosts serotonin levels, another chemical that contributes to happiness and well-being. Additionally, working out provides a healthy outlet for pent-up energy, and the routine of exercise helps create a sense of accomplishment and structure, making it a positive coping mechanism for managing mental health challenges.	Exercise had been shown in many studies to promote the production of serotonin and dopamine, the two neurotransmitters responsible for making you feel good. Evolution has selected for physical activity to make us feel good, making it more likely for us to be physically active, which promotes our physical health. This is called a positive feedback loop, and is an example of one of the many, many positive feedback loops employed in your biochemistry.

There is a nuclear fusion reaction going on at the center of the sun, fusing hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. This is more or less the same reaction that we are trying to implement in fusion reactors here on earth, so that we can get cheap plentiful energy. This reaction produces massive amounts of heat, making the sun extremely hot. As a result, the sun is so hot that it glows brilliantly - the same way that hot lava or molten metal does, only brighter. That is how the sun shines. Edit: nuclear fusion is not to be confused with nuclear fission, which breaks heavy atoms into smaller ones. We do fission at all our nuclear reactors, but we don’t yet have any commercial fusion reactors. The sun doesn’t do fission, only fusion.	"The sun doesn't ""burn"" in the traditional sense like a fire we see on earth. Instead, it undergoes a process called nuclear fusion. In simple terms, nuclear fusion happens when the sun's intense pressure and heat cause hydrogen atoms to combine and form helium atoms. This process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is what we perceive as the sun's brightness and warmth. Think of nuclear fusion like building a lego model - when you connect individual lego bricks (hydrogen atoms) together, you create a new structure (helium atoms) and might generate some extra heat and light from the friction between the pieces. Oxygen isn't needed for this process, as nuclear fusion is different from the chemical reaction that takes place in a fire on earth."

When ice is dropped into a deep fryer, it erupts because the intense heat of the oil causes the water molecules in the ice to rapidly turn into steam. The sudden conversion from ice (solid state) to steam (gas state) creates a violent expansion, forcing oil out of the fryer like an eruption. This process, known as a steam explosion, happens because steam takes up much more space than the original ice.	Steam explosion. Ice is a fairly dense form of water and steam on the other hand is not very dense. When you put ice or even liquid water into hot oil, it basically instantly boils. The water rapidly expands into steam, and a rapid expansion of gas is just another name for explosion. Liquid water will also do this, which is why you should never put out an oil fire with water.

Brine and salt both help to melt ice on roads, but they work differently due to their forms and application methods. Salt, specifically rock salt, is a solid substance that is spread on roads to lower the freezing point of water. When the snow falls on the salted road, it melts the snow and prevents it from turning into ice. However, salt is less effective at very low temperatures, as it can't lower the freezing point enough to prevent icing. Brine, on the other hand, is a liquid solution made of water and a high concentration of salt. It is sprayed onto roads before a snowstorm, creating a protective barrier between the road surface and the snow. When snow falls on the brine-coated road, it is not able to bond with the surface, making it easier to clear away. Also, since brine is a liquid, it covers the road more evenly and starts working immediately. While brine contains water, the high salt content prevents it from freezing and turning into ice.	The brine actually works better at low temperatures *because* its liquidif you just spread the salt then you have to wait for it to melt the snow in direct contact with it to create a salt water mix with a low freezing temperature, this mix then melts other nearby snow and mixes with some more nearby salt and the process continuesbrine skips that first step by just spraying down a salt water concentration so now you don't have to wait for it to start melting nearby snow to start getting an effectthe salty brine mixture is like insanely salty. The ocean is about 3. 5% salinity, road brine is 20-25% salinity, and the dead sea is 34%. The super high salinity means the freezing point of this mix is down to about -6f before it starts mixing with the melt water so its really unlikely to generate new ice of its own

Hot water molecules move faster than cold water molecules, increasing the rate of diffusion. When you put a teabag in hot water, the tea compounds like flavors, colors, and nutrients dissolve and spread out quickly. In cold water, the slower molecular movement causes the diffusion to happen at a much slower rate, leading to a longer steeping time for a good-tasting tea.	A lot of chemical reactions work faster in hotter environments. The reaction itself is called diffusion. It is more of a substance in one area in relation to another area. If there is a way for the substance to go to the other, less concentrated area, it will do so through diffusion until the concentration levels are the same.

Imagine a bunch of friends holding hands and standing close together - that's like the molecules in a solid. They're tightly packed and can't move freely but can still wiggle and jostle in place. This wiggling is due to the constant energy exchange between molecules, as they bump into each other or are influenced by heat from their surroundings. These vibrations increase with temperature; when a solid receives enough heat, molecules vibrate so much that their bonds break, causing the solid to melt into a liquid.	Molecules normally attract each other but begin repelling each other when they get too close. This action is somewhat similar to how a spring works, so you could imagine neighboring molecules in a solid as connected by tiny springs. Obviously this makes the whole molecular structure kinda wobbly - pull on one molecule and through all those springs the other molecules react; let that molecule go and every other molecule reacts as well. And since the surface of the solid is always interacting with something from the outside, this translates into random vibrations of the spring-tied molecules around some average locations.

When a heater dries the air in a closed room, the moisture doesn't actually disappear; it changes form. The process can be explained through a basic understanding of humidity and evaporation. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. When a heater turns on, it raises the temperature of the room. As the air gets warmer, its capacity to hold water vapor increases. This means that the room's relative humidity decreases, making the air feel drier. Meanwhile, the increased temperature causes some of the moisture in the room to evaporate. This evaporated water vapor stays within the room but spreads out, creating a more balanced distribution of humidity. In a closed room, the overall amount of moisture stays the same, but it gets more evenly spread out and held by the warm air, creating a perceived dryness.	No wherethere are two types of humidity but we mostly just talk about relative because that's what determines how things feelabsolute humidity is a measure of how much water is in the airrelative humidity is a measure of how much water is in the air *relative to how much water the air could hold*since hot air can hold more water than cold air, heating the room causes the temperature to go up and therefore the relative humidity to go down because the absolute humidity remained the sameat 10c and 50% humidity(relative) air has 4. 7 grams of water per cubic meter. At 20c 4. 7 grams of water per cubic meter is only about 28% humidity which feels a lot drier to you since the air is more willing to absorb water from you

Each type of plastic has a different chemical composition, melting point, and cannot easily mix with other types of plastics. When plastics mix, they can become impure, which affects the quality and usability of recycled products. To properly recycle plastics, they must be sorted according to their specific category, such as pet, hdpe, or pvc. This sorting process can be time-consuming and not always accurate, leading to contamination and complications. Additionally, some plastic products are made of multiple materials, making them difficult to separate and recycle. Due to these factors, recycling plastic is often less cost-effective than producing new plastic, leading to a greater reliance on virgin materials.	"There is a change in perspective required: everything is recyclable if there is a viable market. That is, if the cost of reclaiming a good is less than we can sell the good for, it's recyclable. It's not a descriptor certain materials enjoy due to their intrinsic properties so much. It's not ""this material can be reclaimed and this one can't"" it's ""this material is too expensive to liberate. ""styrofoam is perfectly recyclable in the sense that it can be reclaimed. But it takes up sooooooo much cargo space, no one wants to do it. It's not economically viable.

When pasta is made, the flour or semolina is mixed with water to form a dough, which is then shaped into various pasta forms. During this process, the proteins in the flour, mainly gluten, form a network that gives the pasta structure and elasticity. This network is stable once the pasta is dried, preventing it from turning back into flour/semolina. When you cook pasta in water, it doesn't dissolve because this protein network is strong enough to maintain its shape. The water mostly works to hydrate and soften the pasta, allowing it to become flexible and easily chewed. This is why pasta can be cooked in water without dissolving but still becomes the tender food we enjoy.	"When you mix water and flour, the glutenin (a type of protein) molecules in the flour start to bind together to form strands of gluten, which you are probably familiar with. If you knead the dough together, the gluten strands develop further, forming longer and longer chains that hold the dough together. So even if you dry the dough back out, the gluten will simply ""set"" in place, holding it together. If you put it in (boiling) water for long enough, you could conceivably dissolve it into the water, but it wouldn't really be flour anymore, as you would be dissolving all the proteins, not just the gluten strands."

These patches contain specific ingredients that create a heating or cooling effect when applied to the skin. Heat patches typically contain iron powder, activated carbon, and other ingredients like salt and water. When the patch is exposed to air, the iron powder reacts with oxygen, generating heat. This heat penetrates the skin, helping to increase blood flow and relax tight muscles, thus reducing pain. On the other hand, cool patches often contain menthol, an organic compound extracted from mint oils. When applied to the skin, menthol triggers the cold-sensitive receptors, providing a cooling sensation. This helps to numb the area and decrease inflammation, which contributes to pain relief. Hot and cool patches generally do not alternate between hot and cold, but are separate types of patches that you can choose depending on your needs. You can use heat patches for muscle stiffness or aches, while cool patches are more suitable for acute injuries, like sprains or strains, where inflammation and swelling are present. When using either type of patch, always follow the instructions on the package to ensure safe and proper use.	The chemical that makes icey hot and it's counterparts work is methyl salicylate and menthol. You may recognize one of those words or more. The first thing that acts is the menthol. Menthol stimulates the nerves we use to detect cold things. This is what gives peppermint or spearmint it's cool feeling on your tongue. No actual change in temperature on your skin happens. The methyl salicylate is similar to aspirin in its structure and when absorbed it causes the blood vessels to dialate. This promotes blood flow to the area which makes the skin feel warm. Especially when contrasted with the cooling effect of menthol. The increased blood flow also helps with muscle repair. So step by step. You've applied the cream and the active ingredient hits your skin. The menthol is absorbed immediately and makes your skin feel cold. The methyl salicylate is absorbed and slowly dialates the tiny blood vessels in your skin. As the blood vessels near the application open up, hot blood flows to the area making the skin feel warm.

The meds for one day could be: adhd medication (stimulant or non-stimulant), something to lower the blood pressure, paracetamol for the migraine, ibuprofen for period cramps, desmopressin for nocturia.	The human body can handle different medications because each drug has specific target sites in the body, called receptors, where they have their intended effect. When you take multiple medications, they travel through the bloodstream and find their unique receptors to do their job. This process is made possible through the liver, which is responsible for breaking down drugs, and the kidneys, which help filter out waste products. However, some medications can interact with each other, changing how they work or causing side effects, so it’s essential to consult a healthcare professional when taking multiple medications.	You're vastly overestimating how *pumped* you can really get. Even people considered to be taking lots of medicines, either by total weight or different drugs, are getting amounts that are completely insignificant compared to the many, many other substances that are already in your blood, both by weight/amount and the complex processes they're accomplishing. If these drugs don't engage in some specific interaction with each other, then they won't get in each other's way. The reason they can still exert their effects despite there being relatively few actual drug molecules in your system is because they're sufficiently potent by weight.
274	3f9616be-ca64-4cb7-bb22-96ff9ea171e8.txt	Why do they make gummy multivitamins and supplements, but no gummy medication drugs?	Gummy multivitamins and supplements are made to encourage consumption, especially for people who dislike swallowing pills. However, gummy medications are not common due to challenges in controlling the dosage, potential for uneven distribution of the drug, and risk of melting or sticking together. Additionally, gummies may attract children, risking unintentional overdose or misuse, making them less suitable for medications compared to supplements.	A vitamin supplement basically just needs to get into the bloodstream as soon as possible so that it can be absorbed. A lot of medications are designed to dissolve and disperse into the body in a slow and controlled way. The form the medication takes (capsule, tablet, powder, liquid, etc. ) plays a big part in how quickly it gets absorbed.
275	e5cefa59-c5c5-4f8c-9b84-506de3d5258a.txt	When rice is boiling over, why do the bubbles immediately go down when you lift the lid?	The starch from the rice allows the water to form bubbles, but not very strongly, so typically the high pressure in the bubble will cause them to burst immediately, but when the lid is on the pot, the hot vapor and air increase the pressure in the air in the pot and lowers the imbalance in pressure, meaning the ambient air pressure is similar to the pressure inside that bubbles, so they don't burst. Opening the lid lowers the pressure, creates an imbalance and causes the bubbles to burst.	When rice boils, the heat causes water to turn into steam, which creates bubbles. These bubbles rise and collect under the lid, causing pressure to build up inside the pot. Lifting the lid releases that pressure, allowing the bubbles to rapidly collapse and lower in size. Additionally, lifting the lid lets cooler air in, which cools the temperature of the steam and water near the surface. Combined, these factors prevent the bubbles from boiling over, and they quickly decrease in size when the lid is lifted.

"Medicines, vitamins and other chemicals are generally either water soluble or fat soluble. Water soluble chemicals can be absorbed directly into your bloodstream and don't need to be taken with food. But fat-soluble chemicals won't dissolve in water, and thus need some fat in your stomach. Generally when a pill is suggested to take ""with food"" or ""with a meal"", it's because it's fat-soluble and almost all food has at least some fat/oil/lipids in it, so they don't bother to specify what kind of food."	"""take with a meal"" pills are designed to be absorbed more efficiently with food. When we eat, our stomach produces acid and enzymes to break down the food, and this process also helps dissolve the pill. Additionally, some medications require fat to be properly absorbed, so taking them with a meal ensures that there's adequate fat content in the digestive system. Overall, the presence of food creates a more suitable environment for the medication to be absorbed and distributed effectively throughout the body."
277	023e3654-6629-40ee-89dc-84df78856f01.txt	How is heat able to basically unite metals?	Heat can unite metals through a process called welding. Essentially, when two metal pieces are heated to a high temperature, their individual atoms gain more energy and start moving rapidly. At a certain point, the surfaces of these metals become almost like a thick, molten liquid. When the two heated surfaces are pressed together, their atoms start to bond with each other, creating a strong, continuous piece of metal. This process works with metals because their atomic structure allows for easy bonding when heated. So, heat helps metals unite by increasing the energy of their atoms and making it easier for them to bond together.	"Welding melts a bit of the metal on each piece. When melted, the metal on each piece can come together and mix; once the parts cool back down, the metal solidifies as a single piece. You can do something similar with ice cubes. Take two ice cubes from the freezer, and push them together. Find that point where they touch, and hold your finger there for a minute or so until you feel the ice cube start melting. Put the cubes back in the freezer in that position, and wait for an hour or two. When you take them back out, they'll have ""welded"" together into a single piece."

And why, even after the bag is open, will a clip over the bag keep them fresh whereas leaving them exposed to the same air will make them go stale?	"Crisps stay fresh in the bag before it's opened because they are not exposed to regular air; instead, they are sealed in a protective atmosphere containing nitrogen gas. A summary of the answer could be: ""crisps stay fresh in their bags due to the nitrogen-rich atmosphere and sealing, but become stale in a household environment due to absorbing moisture from the surrounding air. ""the air we breathe is composed of several gases, including oxygen and moisture. Oxygen can cause food to oxidize, which leads to spoilage, while moisture can make it go stale. To prevent this, crisp manufacturers fill the bags with nitrogen, an inert gas that doesn't react with the crisps, keeping them fresh and crunchy. After opening the bag, the nitrogen is replaced by the surrounding air, and the crisps are exposed to moisture and oxygen. Clipping the bag helps slow down the rate at which the moisture and oxygen enter the bag, keeping the crisps fresher for a longer period. However, once exposed to the air, the crisps will eventually go stale due to absorbing the moisture from the atmosphere, which softens the crisp texture. The clip acts as a barrier, minimizing the exposure to environmental factors that contribute to staleness."	"Chips go bad for two main reasons:* oxygen in the air reacts with the fats in the chips, and* the chips absorb water from the air and become slightly soggy. The ""air"" in the bag is not actually air. It's usually nitrogen gas, which isn't reactive and doesn't result in chemical changes in the food. (air is also mostly nitrogen, but it's the parts that aren't - oxygen and water vapor - that are the problem. )> and why, even after the bag is open, will a clip over the bag keep them fresh whereas leaving them exposed to the same air will make them go stale? Any oxygen inside the bag is quickly consumed. This does make the fats in the chips go ever so slightly rancid, but (a) not enough to really notice and (b) most foods have some antioxidant preservatives in them that can stop this process up to a point. Similarly, any water is absorbed. In an open bag, oxygen and water are constantly flowing it from the environment."

What do they actually contain? What's giving the taste & color ?"	"""no sugar"" soft drinks usually contain artificial sweeteners like aspartame or sucralose, which mimic the sweetness of sugar without adding calories. The taste comes from added flavorings, derived from natural or artificial sources, like fruit extracts or chemical compounds. The color often comes from artificial food coloring to make the drink visually appealing. Besides these, soft drinks also contain water, preservatives for longer shelf life, and sometimes acids like phosphoric or citric acid to provide the fizzy and tangy sensation."	By mass it’s probably 99+% water. The color is either caramel coloring (burned sugar) or one of the dyes cited in the ingredients. The flavor is partially just carbonation (try pure sparkling water some time, it’s quite tangy) and additional citric acid and flavoring chemicals. The specific details of their “natural and artificial flavor” blends are trade secrets - various extracts and synthetic copies of extracts that combine to make the flavor. The sweetness comes from artificial sweeteners aspartame or sucralose. These are *very* sweet so you don’t need much volume.

Like what would happen if I were to mix a gallon of bleach and ammonia in my sink, or bleach and vinegar?	Mixing bleach with other chemicals can produce toxic gases, making it dangerous. For example, when bleach is combined with ammonia, it releases a toxic gas called chloramine. This gas can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, and other health issues. Similarly, when bleach mixes with vinegar, it releases chlorine gas, which can be harmful if inhaled. These reactions are dangerous because the gases produced are toxic and can build up in the surrounding air, posing a risk to people nearby. It's essential to proceed with caution when using bleach and avoid mixing it with other chemicals or substances to prevent harmful reactions.	Bleach is made with chlorine. Ammonia and other chemicals can break the bonds that keep the chlorine in the bleach and make it return to its natural, gaseous form. Chlorine gas combines with water to create hydrochloric acid. If you breathe in chlorine gas, your wet lungs will suddenly be filled with acid and start to dissolve. If you mixed a gallon of ammonia and bleach in your home, you would fill it with deadly gas that would kill everyone and nearly everything inside. The same happens with vinegar. It releases the highly reactive, highly corrosive elemental chlorine gas into the air.
281	b2b1419d-01ef-4056-9020-f0f6d4457124.txt	Why does food break down so easily as opposed to something like a rock which does not break down easily?	Food breaks down more easily than a rock because of its structure and composition. Food is made up of organic compounds like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that are easier to break down due to their chemical bonds. Microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, act on these compounds and easily decompose them, releasing simple nutrient molecules that can be absorbed by plants and animals. For example, think of how fruit rots over time. On the other hand, rocks are made of inorganic materials like minerals that have strong bonds, making them more resistant to breaking down. Although rocks do break down eventually through natural processes like weathering and erosion, it takes a significantly longer time compared to food decomposition.	The molecules in food are much less stable than the molecules (or, well, crystals) in a rock, and your body has a wide range of digestive enzymes (special proteins that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions) that are specifically made to break down the molecules found in your food. Bread, for example, is mostly starch. Starch, in turn, is a chain of loosely-bonded molecules of glucose (a type of simple sugar). Your saliva, and the pancreatic juice that mixes in when food enters your intestine, contain a family of enzymes called *amylases* that attack the bonds between the glucose molecules, splitting the starches into simple sugars. Those sugars then dissolve across your intestinal wall into your blood and are available for use by your body.
282	1d028391-6c5e-4d1d-9531-86b06b0bebd7.txt	Why is some water hard & why is some water soft? Two weeks ago I moved from the midlands to somerset (c90 miles) and have swapped softer water for hard hair-wrecking, skin-drying water. Why do different water agencies supply different water?	Water hardness refers to the amount of dissolved minerals, primarily calcium and magnesium, found in water. The difference between hard and soft water lies in the concentration of these minerals. Water becomes hard when it flows through rocks and soil containing calcium and magnesium compounds. As the water moves, it dissolves these minerals and carries them along. The higher the mineral content, the harder the water. In contrast, soft water has a lower concentration of these minerals. The reason you've experienced a change in water hardness after moving 90 miles is due to geological differences in the areas. The midlands, where you moved from, likely has a different composition of rocks and soil compared to somerset, where you are now. It's not that different water agencies supply different water, but rather that they draw water from different sources with varying mineral concentrations. A simple analogy to understand hard and soft water is to think of a cup of tea. Imagine calcium and magnesium as tea leaves. A cup of tea with more tea leaves will have a stronger taste (hard water), while a cup with fewer leaves will have a milder taste (soft water). Hard water can cause dry skin and hair because the minerals can form a residue on your skin and hair, making it harder for soap and shampoo to rinse fully. Soft water, with fewer minerals, allows for a better lather and more thorough rinsing, leaving your skin and hair feeling cleaner and softer.	It's all about the bedrock that the water supply rests on. Hard water is the result of minerals that dissolve in water, the most common among these are calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Carbonates come from limestone bedrock, which dissolves slightly into the water releasing the dissolved ions and making the water hard. Water that doesn't rest on limestone doesn't have nearly the same level of dissolved ions that water that does rest on limestone bedrock. Fun fact: the carbonates dissolved in hard water add alkalinity to the water reservoir, meaning a buffer system is created to resist the ph dropping down too far. This became a benefit when acid rain peaks in the 80s and 90s as a result of air pollution, where water reservoirs resting on limestone didn't acidify as badly as water reservoirs sitting on other types of bedrock. I'm from new york, and in the adirondack mountains you can tell the difference between lakes sitting on limestone and those sitting on other types of bedrock simply by measuring the ph, as the water sources without a buffering system became so acidified most organisms were unable to live there

Warm water, baking soda, and aluminum create a chemical reaction that removes tarnish from metals like silver and copper, making them shiny. The tarnish is a thin layer of metal oxide, usually caused by exposure to air and moisture. In this process, the metal oxide on the tarnished object reacts with the aluminum, causing the metal oxide to transfer from the tarnished object to the aluminum, leaving the object shiny. This process is called 'electrochemical reduction' and works best with metals like silver, copper, and brass. It doesn't work with all metals because not every metal forms oxide layers that can be removed through this particular chemical reaction.	What makes the metals not nice and shiny is oxidation. When you put tarnished (oxidized) silver in to a bath of baking soda and water and then add aluminum, you're essentially making a battery (aluminum-silver oxide specifically). The oxygen would much rather be with the aluminum and you've created the perfect environment to allow it to move. The oxygen moves over the to the aluminum and you have black aluminum and shiny silver instead of the other way around. The reason it only works with certain metals is that not all metals are different enough to make the battery, and the oxygen must love the shiny metal more than the one you're wanting to make shiny.

Diet sodas are often considered just as bad or worse than regular sodas because they contain artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. These sweeteners, like aspartame or sucralose, can have negative effects on the body. For example, they may confuse the body's natural ability to regulate calorie intake by tricking it into thinking it's consuming real sugar. This can lead to overeating and weight gain. Additionally, some studies have suggested that artificial sweeteners might negatively impact gut bacteria, potentially leading to health issues. While diet sodas have fewer calories than regular sodas, they can still contribute to poor overall health due to these artificial ingredients. Therefore, many people believe they are no better than, or even worse than, regular sodas.	Diet soda's are just as corrosive as regular soda (they contain phosphoric acid) so even when sugar free they are still pretty bad for your teeth. Even though they contain no sugar and few if any calories they still mess with your metabolism and have been connected with weight gain in a number of studies. There's also a lot of studies potentially connecting aspertame to various neurological disorders like learning problems, headache, seizure, migraines, irritable moods, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and there are possible links to dementia later in life. Soda in general (diet or otherwise) isn't good for humans. Once in a while it's fine but definitely not something you should drink daily or in any significant quantities.
285	8d0919e7-4a7c-4528-8129-dfedf4a2ca70.txt	How can a fabric be hydrophobic but also absorb oils and gas? I work at an airport and we use “pig pads” which are absorbent sheets that can be placed on a pool of water and only absorb the fuel, oils, or whatever else while not absorbing any water. What about the sheets allows this?	Hydrophobic fabric can absorb oils and gas while repelling water due to specific properties of the material and the difference in the molecular structure of water and oil. To understand this, we need to break down the concepts of hydrophobicity and oil absorption. Hydrophobic materials have a natural aversion to water, which means they repel it instead of absorbing it. This occurs because the molecules on the surface of the material have a weak attraction to water molecules. Water molecules, on the other hand, are attracted to each other strongly, causing them to stick together and form a droplet that rolls off the hydrophobic surface. Oil and gas, however, have a different molecular structure than water. Unlike water, which is a polar molecule (having a partial positive and negative charge), oil and gas molecules are nonpolar. This means that the attractive forces between oil molecules are not as strong as those between water molecules. The pig pads used at airports are made from materials that are specifically designed to attract and absorb nonpolar substances like oil and gas, while repelling polar substances like water. They do this by incorporating oleophilic (oil-attracting) components in the material. These components have a stronger affinity for the nonpolar molecules found in oil, causing them to be drawn into the pad and absorbed. So, in summary, pig pads can absorb oils and gas while remaining hydrophobic due to the material's selective affinity toward nonpolar substances and their ability to repel polar substances like water. This is made possible by the difference in molecular structure and forces of attraction present in water and oil.	The reason this works is the same reason oil and water don't mix: a phenomenon of chemistry called polarity. Basically every different compound has a different level of polarity, and would prefer to surround itself with molecules of a similar polarity. This causes molecules to separate based on this property, and allows your pads to pick up oil and leave the water behind! Polarity works because of a property called electronegativity, which is a measure of how strongly each element can attract electrons. In a molecule with covalent bonds, electrons are shared. This sharing is not equal however, as the electron does not divide its time equally between the two atoms sharing the bond. Instead, the element with a stronger electronegativity get a larger share of the electron's time, which makes that part of the molecule a little bit negatively charged. This makes a different part of the molecule to have a little bit of a positive charge. The strength of these small relative charges is called the molecules polarity. Wanna hear something really cool? I use this property everyday in my lab in a technique called chromatography to separate the different molecules in human blood and isolate the specific molecule that I'm studying. By dissolving the compounds in a solvent, and running them through a solid of a different t polarity, the molecules separate apart based on their relative polarity.

Stoichiometry (I butters the spelling) is how to explain a chemical reaction. Where on one side of the equation is the chemicals going in, and on the other side the chemicals coming out. It is important to express this in whole numbers because you can’t get half of a chemical compound. For example if I was going to split water into hydrogen and oxygenh2o + energy —> h2 + oso the chemical was water on the left, energy is added, and on the right you have hydrogen and oxygen that is separate.	Gas chromatography (correct term) is a technique used to analyze and separate different components in a mixture. Imagine a race where runners (mixture components) run at different speeds through a track (column). As they race, faster runners finish first, while slower ones lag behind, leading to separation. In gas chromatography, the mixture is vaporized and then pushed through a long, coiled tube (column) with a carrier gas like helium. Each component interacts differently with the tube's inner surface, causing them to exit the column at different times, ultimately separating them for analysis.

This is a chemical reaction between amino acids (protein building blocks) and sugars in the bread which occurs when it is heated. As the bread gets toasted, the maillard reaction causes the proteins and sugars to break down and recombine, forming new compounds that give toasted bread its distinct flavor and aroma. Additionally, moisture in the bread evaporates during the toasting process. The combination of these factors leads to the harder, crispy texture of toasted bread.	When you toast bread, you are dehydrating the exterior, and by removing moisture you hard the bred harder (just like when it goes stale). Unlike when it goes stale, the heat is causing something called the maillard reaction to happen, which is the chemical reaction in food that makes crust of bread, the hard exterior bits on steak, etc. During the maillard reaction, sugars and proteins both caramalize and produce complex molecules that weren't in the food in the first place, and give the depth of flavor we love about the exteriors of cooked foods!

When we first came across pockets of gases underground, what did the process of us actually recognizing these things look like? Did we know what to look for?	Scientists discovered and catalogued odorless and invisible gases like natural gas and helium through careful experimentation and observation. In the early days, they would collect the gas by trapping it in a sealed, airtight container and then analyze its properties, such as its density and reactions with other substances. For example, when helium was discovered, scientists noticed that it didn't burn, unlike other gases, which made it unique and easier to identify.	By accident. Helium was discovered in the late 1800s when scientists pointed spectrometers at the sun during an eclipse and saw a line they'd never seen before. Later in the 1800s it was successfully separated from clevetite, an ore containing uranium. One of the products of uranium decay is helium. We don't know when natural gas was discovered precisely, but the french encountered native americans setting it on fire in the 1600s.

How do you split an atom anyways? ?	Imagine you've got a mousetrap set up so that when it snaps, it throws a bunch of bb's in alll directions. Put thousands of these mousetraps together in a room and snap one of them. It throws its bbs, which will almost certainly snap more mousetraps, which throw even more bbs which snaps even more mousetraps. This process continues until the mousetraps are all (or mostly) used up. The same happens with splitting atoms. By bombarding uranium atoms (mousetraps) with neutrons (bbs), you can destabilize them, causing them to break apart. When they do, they'll release a bunch of energy and more neutrons. Those neutrons then hit other uranium atoms, causing them to split and continuing the chain reaction.	"Splitting an atom releases a large amount of energy, which can lead to a massive explosion, like in an atomic bomb. This process is called nuclear fission. It doesn't work by splitting just one atom; instead, a chain reaction is needed, where multiple atoms are split rapidly. This chain reaction starts when a neutron hits an unstable atom (like uranium or plutonium), causing it to split and release more neutrons. These released neutrons then hit other atoms, causing them to split as well. To initiate this chain reaction, a small amount of material called a ""critical mass"" is required. In a bomb, conventional explosives are used to compress this material, triggering the chain reaction and the explosion."

If taking supplements / vitamins or drinking tea is supposed to improve your health or immune system, why on these types of products there is a statement saying that the product is not suitable for pregnant and lactating women?	This depends entirely on the supplement or tea. It's definitely not true that pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn't have any supplements or tea. In fact, certain supplements are very much recommended during pregnancy, because the demands of pregnancy on the body mean that you use these nutrients more, and/or because a deficiency in these nutrients can harm the development of the foetus. There are special prenatal vitamin supplements that contain these nutrients (e.g. Folic acid, iron, iodine, vitamin d). Other supplements can be harmful during pregnancy, such as vitamin a, for instance. Too much vitamin a can harm the foetus' development, and the risk with vitamin a is that (being fat-soluble) it builds up in the body rather than the excess simply getting peed out. So it really all depends on the supplement. Some are decidedly good to take during pregnancy, others are bad or risky, and yet others don't really matter much one way or the other. As for tea: black and green teas contain caffeine, which is okay during pregnancy as long as you don't have a lot of it (though some fundamentalists will panic at even the slightest hint of caffeine). Tea being weaker in caffeine than coffee (the brewed drink, that is), you can safely drink a few cups of it every day (however, this isn't medical advice and there may be cases where this isn't a good idea). However, there are some herbal teas that have other effects on the body. For instance, teas made with licorice root raise your blood pressure, and that can be dangerous during pregnancy, mainly because pregnancy already brings a risk of high blood pressure. For the same reason, people who suffer from chronic high blood pressure also need to avoid these teas. Healthy people can drink them, in moderation, because they can afford to raise their blood pressure a little.	The main reason that some supplements, vitamins, and teas are not recommended for pregnant and lactating women is that certain substances can cross the placenta or be passed through breast milk, potentially affecting the baby's development and health. While these products may have health benefits for non-pregnant individuals, they may pose risks for pregnant or breastfeeding women and their babies. Pregnant and lactating women have different nutritional requirements than other adults. Certain substances might be harmful to the developing baby, even if they're considered safe for non-pregnant adults. For example, too much vitamin a during pregnancy can lead to birth defects, so pregnant women need to be cautious about their vitamin a intake. Also, some herbal teas contain herbs that can stimulate contractions or affect hormone levels, potentially causing complications during pregnancy. Another concern is that supplements and vitamins are not always tightly regulated, meaning that the content and purity of these products can vary. Some may contain contaminants or ingredients that are not listed on the label, posing additional risks to pregnant and lactating women and their babies. It's important that pregnant and lactating women get the necessary nutrients for their own health and the health of their babies, but the best way to do this is usually through a balanced diet. If a supplement is needed, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to ensure the supplement is appropriate and contains the right amount of each nutrient. In summary, the reason some supplements, vitamins, and teas are not suitable for pregnant and lactating women is due to the potential risks they may pose to the developing baby as certain substances can cross the placenta or be passed through breast milk. Pregnant and lactating women have different nutritional needs, and the safest way to meet these needs is usually through a balanced diet combined with guidance from a healthcare professional on any necessary supplements.

One starts as a solid and one starts as a liquid but they’re both soap right? Why do your hands feel so much different between the two?	"The primary reason bar soap leaves your hands feeling grippy, while liquid soap leaves them feeling moist, is due to the different ingredients and formulation processes used in making these types of soap. In essence, both bar and liquid soaps are made using a similar process called saponification, which involves combining fats or oils with an alkali (like sodium or potassium hydroxide). However, the specific ingredients and proportions used in the process vary between the two types of soap, resulting in distinct properties and textures. Bar soap typically contains higher percentages of fatty acids derived from oils such as coconut, palm, or tallow, which make the soap more solid and harder. It also contains glycerin, a byproduct of the saponification process that provides moisturizing properties. However, because of its solid form and the presence of insoluble compounds (such as salts or minerals), bar soap can have a more abrasive texture and leave behind a thin film after rinsing. This film, combined with the ""squeaky-clean"" feeling after removing oils and dirt, can result in the grippy sensation on your hands. On the other hand, liquid soap has a higher water content, which gives it a smoother and more fluid texture. The saponification process for liquid soap typically involves using potassium hydroxide instead of sodium hydroxide, resulting in softer soaps that dissolve more readily in water. Additionally, liquid soaps often contain extra moisturizing agents, such as glycols or alcohols, that help maintain the feeling of moisture after use. To envision the difference, you can think of bar soap as a dry eraser that ""scrubs"" the dirt away, leaving your hands dry and grippy, whereas liquid soap can be likened to a wet sponge that gently cleans your hands and leaves them feeling hydrated and moist. In summary, the primary difference in how your hands feel after using bar soap and liquid soap lies in their unique formulation, with bar soap containing higher percentages of fatty acids and insoluble compounds, and liquid soap incorporating more water and moisturizing agents, giving each of them distinct cleaning and sensory"	There's one major difference between liquid and solid soap: solid soap is made with sodium salts, while liquid soap is made with potassium salts. So, they aren't technically the same. What you're noticing is not related strictly to liquid vs solid soap though. Pure liquid soap leaves your hands feeling exactly the same as solid soap. The thing is that it's easier to add moisturizing agents(typically oils) in liquid soap, so most do so. That's because if you added a bunch of moisturizing agents to a bar of soap, the integrity of it would be affected too much. Probably it would be gooey and maybe fall apart. That wouldn't make a great impression on the user. In contrast, adding moisturizer to liquid soap barely changes anything of its properties except make it a slightly less effective soap, which isn't too noticeable. The difference between washing your hands with vs without added moisturizers is that without them the soap cleans your hands period. It leaves nothing, strips the skin entirely. The natural layer of oils that our skin constantly oozes is removed along with the dirt. Your hands are now squeaky clean and probably quite dry, so grippy. When moisturizer is added, it cleans your hands but at the same time it will leave a layer of new oil to the skin. The result is that your hands won't feel quite as squeaky dry. Additionally, liquid soap these days often isn't technically soap at all(defined as being saponified oils). It's a concoction of detergents, emulsifiers and other stuff, which makes it *behave* as soap, but technically isn't really at all which wrecks the whole foundation of comparison.

Ozone machines, also known as ozone generators, are devices that produce ozone gas to remove odors and disinfect spaces. They work by breaking down odor-causing molecules and microorganisms, making them a powerful tool for eliminating unwanted smells. However, ozone can be dangerous to humans and animals if proper precautions are not taken, which is why proper personal protective equipment (ppe) is essential when using these machines. To understand how ozone machines remove odors, we need to first explain what ozone is. Ozone (o3) is a type of oxygen molecule composed of three oxygen atoms rather than the usual two found in the oxygen we breathe (o2). It is highly reactive and has a strong oxidizing property, which means it can very efficiently break down molecules and neutralize them. This oxidizing ability is what makes ozone effective for deodorizing and disinfecting. When an ozone machine is in operation, it generates ozone gas by passing a high voltage electric current through air or oxygen. This is known as the corona discharge method, and the process creates a small electrical storm that breaks apart the oxygen molecules (o2) into individual atoms. These free oxygen atoms then bond with other oxygen molecules to form the reactive ozone molecules (o3). Once the ozone is produced, it goes to work on odors by breaking down the chemical bonds of odor-causing molecules, such as those from cigarette smoke, mold, or pet odors. This reaction changes the structure of the offending molecules and removes their odor-causing properties. Ozone is also effective at neutralizing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, which can help to disinfect a space and prevent the spread of diseases. Now, let's discuss the dangers of ozone and the importance of using proper ppe. Ozone gas can be harmful to humans and animals because it is a powerful oxidizer, not just for odor-causing molecules, but also for our body tissues. When inhaled, ozone can damage the cells in our lungs and respiratory system. Exposure to high concentrations of ozone can lead to difficulty breathing, coughing, chest pain, or even more severe health issues, such as lung damage and asthma exacerbation. To mitigate these risks, it's important to use proper ppe when operating an ozone machine. This may include wearing gloves, goggles, and a respirator or a mask designed to filter out ozone particles. Additionally, people and pets should not be present in the area where the ozone machine is being used, and the space should be well-ventilated after the treatment to allow for the ozone gas to dissipate. In summary, ozone machines work by generating ozone gas, which is a highly reactive molecule that can break down and neutralize odor-causing compounds and microorganisms. This makes them an effective tool for deodorizing and disinfecting spaces. However, due to the potential health risks associated with ozone exposure, it's crucial to use proper ppe and follow safety guidelines when operating these machines. By doing so, you can harness the power of ozone to eliminate odors and clean the air while protecting the health of those around you.	"Oxygen is a *very* grabby element. It wants to hold onto electrons very tightly, which is why it forms very strong bonds with things like carbon. Oxygen essentially can't exist on its own, it's too reactive. So, oxygen in the air is mostly in the form o2, where two oxygen atoms are sharing their electrons with each other. However, it really *doesn't* like sharing its electrons with other oxygen atoms, because they all want to grab the electrons, like a game of tug of war. So when you put *three* oxygen atoms together (ozone, o3) they **really** don't want to share, even a little bit. They'll share with o2 well enough but a third oxygen atom just is not welcome to that party. As soon as the ozone comes into contact with anything else, one of the oxygen atoms will pop off and grab onto that other thing, hard. Oxygen grabs harder than almost any other element, so if the oxygen grabs onto an atom, the atom may have to let go of an atom that it was holding. In this way, the ""lone"" single oxygen atom tears apart other molecules. If that molecule is a smelly odor-causing molecule, it gets torn up and probably doesn't cause an odor anymore. If you just have a bunch of o2, that will still kind of happen but it takes a little more energy to get the two oxygen atoms to fall apart. Even if they don't like sharing, if one oxygen atom leaves, the other would be alone which is too unstable, so they tend to stay together unless both of them get bind to new atoms. If you have a bunch of free oxygen atoms, they will immediate react with each other and pair up, or react to whatever you're trying to hold them in an burn/explode. Ozone splits that difference - stable enough to carry around that extra oxygen that can react to things, but not so unstable that it reacts before it has a chance to get there. It's dangerous because ozone doesn't particularly care what it's reacting with. If it gets in your lungs, it'll do the same thing to all the molecules in your lungs that it will do to odor molecules in the air. If it gets into your blood, it'll do the same thing to molecules in your blood. It's just not a great thing to get in your body. It's fine if the levels in the air are low enough - after all, as long as it's reacting to stuff in the air then it's destroying itself before much of it can get to you. If the levels get too high, though, enough of it will survive long enough to get to you, and then you have a problem."

Looked a bit further and saw rum, tequila, whiskey… that are nonalcoholic and am confused as to how they can create them.	"Non-alcoholic beers and spirits are created by removing or reducing the alcohol content while preserving as much of the original taste, aroma, and texture as possible. It's a tricky and complex process, but let me break it down for you. One primary method for making non-alcoholic beer is called ""dealcoholization,"" which involves producing regular beer first and then removing the alcohol from it. There are different techniques to do this, with two common ones being vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis. In vacuum distillation, beer is heated in a vacuum, which enables the evaporation of alcohol at a lower temperature than boiling. This way, the beer doesn't lose its essential flavors that are sensitive to high temperatures. After collecting the alcohol vapor, the beer is blended back together with the non-alcoholic components to achieve the desired alcohol level. Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, involves forcing beer through a semi-permeable membrane that only allows water and smaller molecules like alcohol to pass through. The alcohol is then separated from the water, and the remaining solution is mixed back with the concentrated beer, which has retained its flavor. For non-alcoholic spirits, the process is different as they're typically made by utilizing a combination of botanicals and flavors that mimic the taste and aroma of alcoholic versions without using alcohol itself. The ingredients can be infused or distilled with water to extract the desired flavors and create a beverage that resembles the original drink but without the alcohol content. In summary, non-alcoholic beers and spirits are made by removing or reducing their alcohol content while preserving their original taste and aroma, using various dealcoholization techniques or flavor-mimicking strategies."	"Start with ""normal"" wine, beer, or spirits. 1 use membranes that the water and alcohol pass through, but the sugars, other stuff doesn't. Next, a membrane that water and stuff passes through but alcohol does not. Recombine the components that doesn't have alcohol in it. It works because the size of the water and alcohol molecules is different. 2. Gently heat the wine/beer/booze, until it is wall enough for the alcohol to boil off, but the water does not boil. The problem is, everything that boils away at a cooler temperature than alcohol is also lost. You can collect that vapour and put it back in without the alcohol. You can reduce the boiling point of alcohol by applying a vacuum... This way it is easier to separate the alcohol from the other stuff in your drink, and you don't need as much heat, so your drink doesn't taste boiled. 3 combine #2 methods with a technique to create a thin film of the wine/beer/spirits by spinning a cone that spreads out the liquid, making it easier to separate the alcohol. This is the method I understand the least. Tldr. You can boil off the alcohol (using methods that use less heat), or pass it through membrane filters that filter out the alcohol. The trick is to separate the alcohol out without removing or changing the other components in the drink."

Seems like most sunscreens include labels saying to store below 30 degrees (celsius) or risk reduced efficacy, but how do they function on the skin (which would be, on average, higher than 30 degrees?)?	Sunscreen becomes less effective at high temperatures due to its chemical ingredients changing or breaking down. On our skin, sunscreen doesn't reach the same high temperatures because it quickly evaporates or absorbs, preventing heat buildup. Also, our bodies naturally cool themselves with sweat or blood circulation. When applied correctly, sunscreen creates a protective barrier that absorbs or reflects harmful uv rays, helping to prevent sunburn or other skin damage.	>seems like most sunscreens include labels saying to store below 30 degrees (celsius) or risk reduced efficacy, but how do they function on the skin (which would be, on average, higher than 30 degrees? )?

When a candle is lit, the heat from the flame melts the wax, turning it into a vapor. This vapor travels up the wick and gets broken down into molecules by the flame's heat, which then react with oxygen to create a combustion process. This process produces a clean, smokeless flame because the wax molecules are completely consumed during combustion. However, when you blow out a candle, the combustion process stops, but the wick remains hot enough to keep vaporizing some wax. Since there's no flame to break down the wax molecules and fully burn them, they become tiny unburned particles that scatter into the air, forming visible smoke.	Smoke is a result of incomplete combustion. Candle flame is the result of wax melting, being drawn up through the wick, then vaporizing and combining with oxygen in the air. With enough heat and oxygen the vaporized wax will completely oxidize (combine with oxygen) and the majority of the resulting chemicals will be invisible gasses. If there's not enough oxygen, or not enough heat, then the wax will only partially oxidize, and the wick will start to burn as well. The result of this partial combustion is smoke, a mix of a lot of different chemicals, including many heavier particles that become tiny bits of solid as they cool.

Eggs are a versatile and essential ingredient in baking because they serve multiple important functions, such as acting as a binder, providing structure, and adding moisture. To understand this, we can break it down into three main roles eggs play in baking:1. Binding: eggs help to hold ingredients together. When an egg is mixed into a batter, the proteins in the egg whites and yolks combine with the other ingredients, and upon cooking, coagulate or set, creating a solid structure. This is why we often see ingredients like flour, sugar, and butter sticking together in baked goods. 2. Leavening: eggs help baked goods rise. While not the only leavening agent, eggs, particularly egg whites, trap air bubbles when whipped, creating foam. This foam then expands when heated, causing the baked goods to rise and giving them a light, fluffy texture. Think of a soufflé, which heavily relies on whipped egg whites to achieve its height. 3. Moisture and richness: eggs contribute to the overall texture and flavor of baked goods. The water content in eggs adds moisture, while the fat in the egg yolks lends a rich, creamy taste. This results in moist and tender cakes or pastries. In summary, eggs are a magical ingredient in baking because they offer binding, leavening, and added moisture, resulting in delicious and well-structured products.	The white of the egg is 90% water and 10% protein. The yolks are 50% water, 30% fat, and 20% protein. Yolks are also emulsifiers, meaning that they make it so that fats and water can mix; there's chemicals in yolks called lecithins that have a long oily bit that likes to be near fats at one end, and a charged bit that likes to touch water at the other, letting the fat and water to get close. The egg doesn't have a lot of tough stringy stuff holding it together like meat, and the water in there makes it easy to mix and pour. The protein can be whipped so it unfolds and makes a foam that traps air. The protein in eggs also unfolds when cooked making it hold together things and trap in moisture. The yolks allow oil and water to mix so they won't separate (yay, mayonaise! ) and are also very good at trapping in moisture, but have much less protein so they make for something softer and less rubbery. Eggs also have the advantage that hens lay lots of them, so they're plentiful (unless a bird flu is going around).

It fully makes sense that it’s complicated to get the texture right, but why have I never been able to find a product that tastes like real bacon, for example? What makes it more than just the right combination of chemicals for a bacon flavour?	"The difficulty in making vegetarian/vegan meat replacement foods taste like real meat comes from the complex combination of flavors, textures, and chemical reactions that occur in meat during the cooking process. While it might be possible to recreate some aspects of the flavor, capturing the full experience of consuming meat is a challenging task. Meat flavor comes from a mix of compounds that are either naturally present in the meat or created during the cooking process. One key contributor to the flavor is the maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars. This reaction creates a golden-brown crust on the surface of the meat and generates hundreds of volatile compounds, giving the meat its distinct flavor and aroma. Furthermore, fats and connective tissues in the meat play important roles in creating a rich, mouth-watering taste. Vegan and vegetarian meat alternatives are typically made from plant-based proteins like soy, wheat, and peas, which have their own distinct flavors and textures. They often need to be combined and processed in a way that mimics the structure and mouthfeel of real meat, which can be a challenge in itself. As for the flavor, food scientists and chefs have made progress in mimicking the taste of meat by using various combinations of spices, flavorings, and ingredients. For example, they might use liquid smoke, paprika, or nutritional yeast to mimic the smoky, savory, and ""umami"" flavors often associated with real meat. However, recreating the exact complex mix of flavors found in meat is still a work in progress. In summary, replicating the taste of real meat in vegetarian/vegan alternatives is difficult due to the complex combination of flavors and chemical reactions that occur in meat during cooking. Though significant progress has been made, perfectly imitating the full experience of consuming meat remains a challenging feat for food scientists and chefs alike."	Imagine you’re a textile maker, and you want to make a lovely shirt that feels just like silk, but you want to make it with leather. There are ways you can treat the leather to make it easier to turn into a shirt, but no matter what it’s gonna be really hard to make it look and feel just like silk. It comes down to the fact that you’re using different materials with different properties, so the more you want to change the material’s properties the harder it is to actually make it happen. It’s the same kind of thing with plants and animal products - they’re different materials with different properties. Plants can still give you the same nutrition as meat, just like leather can still give you the same items of clothing as silk - but the properties of flavor, look, and feel are going to be different because they’re made of different materials. There are a lot of people working on some really interesting ways to make plants taste more like meat, and it’s definitely improving, but it may not ever be 100% the same - because you can only alter materials so much before you start hitting diminishing returns (which is maybe beyond a 5 year olds grasp, but whatever). Speaking as someone who’s been a vegetarian for a few years now, i’ve always preferred just making vegetables taste really good instead of trying to make them approximate meat. I may not ever enjoy meat flavors again, but there are plenty of other things that are just as satisfying. Though I did have an impossible whopper the other day and it was a little off-putting how meat-like it was!

H2O (water) and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) may look similar, but they have different properties. Water is essential for life because it helps transport nutrients, maintain body temperature, and support necessary chemical reactions. Hydrogen peroxide, on the other hand, is dangerous to drink because it's a powerful oxidizer, which means it can cause chemical reactions that damage cells and tissues. Imagine water as a helpful delivery person and hydrogen peroxide as a harmful, reactive substance that can ruin the items being delivered.

"The sea doesn't freeze in freezing temperatures mainly due to the salt content in seawater. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so the water has to get colder than usual before it turns into ice. This is called the ""freezing point depression. "" the average seawater has a lower freezing point of around 28. 4°f (-2°c) compared to freshwater's 32°f (0°c). In addition, the vast amount of water in the ocean and the movement of its currents help distribute the heat, making it harder to freeze. So, while parts of the sea near the shore or in polar regions can freeze, the majority of it remains liquid even in freezing temperatures."	(1) the sea has dissolved salts that lower its freezing point. (2) water has a high heat capacity that means it needs to be in contact with cold air for a long time to reduce its temperature below its freezing point. (3) wave motion is constantly mixing warmer water from below at the surface(4) cold water is denser than warm water so it will sink before it freezer bringing warmer water up. Of course sea water does freeze in the artic and antarctic, and also in sea lochs or fjords which are more still and shallow. Often fresh water runoff will help them to freeze.

Like, if I fill up a glass 3/4 of ice and the rest with water, the glass is still at the same water level even after the ice has melted. You would think the water would take up more volume once in its liquid state.	you would think the water would take up more volume once in its liquid state…. You might think that, and most materials that would be true, but water has the rare quality that its solid state actually takes up **more** volume than its liquid state. This is after all why it floats, as it displaces more volume than its weight in liquid water. As for why the water level doesn't change, anything floating in water will displace its weight equivalent in volume of water. So if a ship weighs 100 tons it would displace a volume of water equal to 100 tons; if its hull isn't big enough to do that then it will sink! Ice takes up slightly more volume than liquid water so a bit of ice pokes up out of the water as it floats, but when it melts it reduces in volume and takes up precisely the volume it displaced meaning the water level doesn't change.	The volume of water in the glass remains the same after the ice melts because of a principle called displacement. When you add ice to a glass, the ice takes up space and displaces an equal volume of water. In other words, the ice is pushing the water out of its way to make room for itself. Ice is actually less dense than water, meaning that it takes up slightly more space than an equivalent mass of water. When ice melts, it contracts and turns into water, taking up less space. However, the decrease in volume from ice to water is equal to the amount of water it initially displaced. This is because as the ice melts and its volume decreases, the water it displaced occupies the space that was previously taken by the ice. In summary, the volume of water in the glass stays the same after the ice has melted because the ice displaces an equal volume of water, and this displaced water takes up the space left by the melting ice.

When water is added to boiling oil, it quickly turns to steam due to the oil's high temperature. Since steam takes up more space than water, it rapidly expands, causing the oil to splash everywhere. On the other hand, when oil is added to boiling water, the temperature is lower and the oil doesn't evaporate. Instead, it floats on the water's surface because it's less dense, preventing any violent splashing or eruptions.	Oil boils at a higher temperature. So adding water to boiling ail makes it evaporate **instantly** ripping oil with it on the way up (since it's heavier than oil when liquid, but lighter when evaporated it basically shovels the oil into the air)in the other way around the boiling water is too cold to even make the oil boil at all. It will just sit on top of the water as a film.

"That's because our sense of taste is really closely tied to our sense of smell as well. To the point that a lot of people, unless they have been specifically trained, might not even realize that the ""taste"" of something is largely from an aromatic compound they are actually *smelling*. That said, if you somehow perfectly got the actual flavor compounds right, and got the aromatics just right you could almost make something that at least ""tastes"" like the real thing. Except then there are also things like temperature and texture/mouth feel that affect it too. So a gummy that tastes *exactly* like a big mac isn't going to trick anyone. Because a big mac isn't just ""big mac flavor"" it's about how two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun feel in your mouth."	The tongue can detect five basic tastes, but flavor is more than just taste. Flavor is a combination of taste, aroma, texture, and even temperature. While we may be able to combine the five basic tastes to imitate certain flavors, it's difficult to reproduce every flavor in this way because our perception of flavor also relies heavily on our sense of smell. When we eat, the aroma molecules from food travel to our olfactory receptors (located in the nose), which play a significant role in how we perceive flavor. There are thousands of different aroma molecules, and many of these can't be recreated solely through the combination of the basic tastes. Additionally, texture contributes to the overall experience of a flavor, and mixing sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami elements cannot replicate this aspect. So while it might be possible to mimic some flavors using just the five basic tastes, it's not enough to create a perfect replica of every flavor.

"Generally it's because when you pour the first batch, you also had just applied some type of oil/butter to ""prevent them from sticking to the pan"".

When making pancakes, the first batch takes longer to brown because the pan is still heating up and adjusting to the ideal temperature. In addition, when you pour oil or butter onto the pan, it usually gets absorbed by the first batch, leaving a thin layer on the pan. This thin layer helps to conduct heat more efficiently, making the following batches of pancakes brown faster. So, it's the combination of ideal temperature and the oil/butter layer that speeds up the browning process.

"Caffeine is a stimulant that temporarily boosts your heart rate and blood pressure. When you drink a beverage containing caffeine, like coffee or an energy drink, it gets absorbed into your bloodstream and blocks a neurotransmitter called adenosine, which is responsible for making you feel drowsy. By blocking adenosine, caffeine essentially tricks your brain into thinking you're more awake than you actually are. The main reason energy drinks are considered ""bad"" is that they often contain high levels of caffeine and sugar, as well as other stimulants like taurine and guarana. This combination can lead to a sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be dangerous for some individuals, particularly those with pre-existing heart conditions or high blood pressure. In extreme cases, excessive consumption of energy drinks has been linked to heart problems and even death. Additionally, the high sugar content in energy drinks contributes to weight gain and dental issues, while the stimulating effects of caffeine can lead to sleep disruption, anxiety, and even addiction. While energy drinks may provide a temporary energy boost, consuming them in high quantities or regularly over time can have negative consequences on your overall health."	Caffeine itself isn’t that bad for most adults in low amounts. Tea and coffee contain caffeine and aren’t bad for you unless you drink way too much. Cola contains caffeine and while it’s not good for you, it’s the sugar that is the issue. Energy drinks are often more concentrated, but most don’t have enough caffeine to harm you in a single can. However, they’re full of sugar and other things. A lot of the way energy drinks are marketed is the problem as well. Their marketing plus the sugar (or sugar substitutes) make them appealing to younger consumers and easier to drink too much of compared to coffee and tea, which are bitter in their natural state. Developing children shouldn’t drink as much caffeine as an adult can handle.

Milk products in homemade frosting don't spoil easily when left out because the high sugar content acts as a preservative. Sugar binds to water molecules, making it difficult for microorganisms like bacteria and mold to grow. As a result, frostings can stay safe at room temperature for a few days. However, hot or humid environments or the use of fresh cream can shorten this shelf life, so refrigeration may be necessary in some cases.	They will spoil eventually if left to do so. Frosting does however contain a lot of sugar, which inhibits spoiling by drawing moisture out of its surroundings. Microorganisms which cause spoilage need that water to survive and will die if they get dehydrated. And frosting is relatively dry to begin with. But you probably shouldn't eat a cake which has been out for like, days and days. The drier and sweeter probably the longer it can last.

Food producers determine the best before date through a combination of scientific testing and observation. They test the product over time to monitor changes in its quality, including taste, texture, and appearance. By comparing these changes with established safety and quality standards, producers can estimate how long the product will maintain its optimal condition. For foods with long shelf lives, manufacturers might also use accelerated testing methods, where they expose the food to higher temperatures to speed up the aging process and then extrapolate the results to predict the shelf life at normal conditions.	"The ""best before"" date is actualy a ""tastes optimal if opened before"". It's a guestimate, based on experiments. It has nothing to do with food spoiling, so they can afford to approximate. Usually, there are some tests before launching some new product line with different sealed containers sitting there for different amounts of time at room temperature or fridges. For dates a year or more away, they guess using science. Petri dish cultures, for example, can help them extrapolate future dates just by watching the bacteria growth rate."

During fermentation, yeast, a microscopic organism, consumes the sugar naturally present in grape juice. As the yeast breaks down the sugar, alcohol - specifically ethanol - and carbon dioxide are produced as byproducts. This conversion of sugar to alcohol is what gives red wine its alcoholic content. Different types of yeast and varying amounts of sugar in the grape juice can affect the final alcohol level in the wine. Moreover, the duration of the fermentation process can also influence the alcohol content, with a longer fermentation time typically resulting in a higher alcohol percentage.	"Ever notice how [wine grapes are sort of white and fuzzy](https://images.ctfassets.net/zpx0hfp3jryq/48utntrfuxnxjjy6zfdvt7/a0b4dbb3437bec8b65f6f678e8a9c83d/what-are-wine-grapes. Jpg) while the grapes you buy at the supermarket are shiny? That white fuzz is wild yeast that grows on the skin of the grape. When they harvest the grapes and put them in a vessel for fermentation, they mash everything together including the yeast on the outside. The yeast eats the sugar in the grape juice and poops out alcohol, gradually replacing most of the sugar with booze until the alcohol level gets too high for the yeast to survive and fermentation stops. Now your non-alcoholic grape juice (known as ""must"" in the winemaking world) is alcoholic wine!"

Is that not considered a part of that particular valence energy level? Wouldn't it be accurate to say all noble gases have full s and p sub-levels instead?	The heavier noble gases do have a full d-shell as well. You can fill four successive s orbitals before a d-shell configuration becomes energetically favorable, so there is no d-shell for helium, neon, and argon. Krypton has a filled d-orbital. Helium only has a full 1s, no p or d.	Yes, noble gases have full valence shells in their s and p sublevels. The d-sublevel, which belongs to a lower energy level than the valence shells, is not considered when describing a noble gas's electron configuration. This full s and p configuration makes noble gases stable and unreactive.

Why not just dilute the active ingredient with something like water or other non-harsh chemicals. For example, benadryl.	Active ingredients are mixed with inactive ingredients to improve the overall effectiveness and usability of a product. Inactive ingredients can help with the taste, texture, appearance, and stability of a product, making it easier to consume or apply. They can also enhance the absorption of the active ingredient, ensuring it reaches the targeted area in the body. Using water or non-harsh chemicals might not always provide these benefits, which could lead to a less effective and less user-friendly product.	"It depends on the ""inactive"" ingredient. Often it's there to add mass and make the pill manipulable, but they may also shelf-stabilize the medication, help in timing it's release within the body so it gets where it needs to go whether that means a slow release or just not dissolving instantly in your mouth, improve taste to make it palatable to take, wax or sugar coatings let you swallow them instead of them just sticking. Lots of little things like that."

Which, sure, it's a big gem. But if it was possible to make unreasonably large gems, we'd be seeing one-piece emerald kitchen counter slabs on the market right now and people with enough means would be making gemstone windows.	"The largest synthetic gemstones are actually **huge**. We can grow some single(! ) crystals such as quartz and sapphires that are way beyond anything natural, in the hundreds of kilograms, and that at an extreme purity. Or with a precisely controlled impurity to give them a certain color: pure sapphire is transparent like glass, add 1% chromium to make it a red ruby (yes, ruby is just a variant of sapphire), or add 0. 01% iron to make it blue, and many other colors. Alexandrite and emerald can also be grown quite well, but it is a bit more complex and thus more expensive. And unlike sapphire, they have a less wide use in industrial and consumer applications, adding further to the cost and lack of interest to optimize their size. Meanwhile, large so-called boules of sapphire are used for very sturdy ""glass"" (not really a glass), and ruby is used for lasers. Diamonds however are quite finicky, they need quite extreme conditions to grow. Even more if one wants them to be extremely pure so that they are perfectly transparent. It is also not clear what a very large diamond is ultimately useful for beyond what the much cheaper sapphire can do; the little bit of extra hardness doesn't do that much. There are however some applications as thermal conductors, as diamonds are the best one known."	"The main reason why lab-grown gemstones are still relatively small is due to the limitations in the growing process and the increasing complexity and costs associated with creating larger gemstones. To create lab-grown gemstones, scientists use methods like the czochralski process or the high-pressure high-temperature (hpht) process. These methods involve placing a small ""seed"" of the desired gemstone material in a controlled environment where the necessary elements are then allowed to grow around this seed, forming the gemstone. However, as the gemstone gets bigger, the challenge of maintaining a stable growth environment increases. This means that producing larger gemstones takes more time, effort, and resources, and the chance of errors and imperfections also rises. For example, maintaining a consistent temperature and pressure throughout a large gemstone is extremely difficult. Any irregularities (i.e. , fluctuations in temperature and pressure) can lead to internal cracks and other defects in the final product, making it less desirable and valuable. Another factor is the costs associated with producing larger gemstones. The raw materials, energy consumption, and specialized equipment required for the growth process tend to become more expensive as the size of the gemstone increases. In summary, the reasons for the limited size of lab-grown gemstones primarily revolve around the challenges in the growing process, the increased complexity and risk of defects, and the higher costs associated with producing larger gemstones. As a result, we do not currently see unreasonably large lab-grown gemstones, such as one-piece emerald kitchen counter slabs or gemstone windows."

Water expands as it turns into steam because its molecules move faster and spread out. When you pour 1 liter of water into a burning chimney, the intense heat causes the water to boil rapidly and turn into steam. The steam then expands to take up a larger volume, which can be around 1700 times the original volume of the water. This expansion occurs because steam has lower density compared to liquid water, meaning that the same mass of steam needs more space. In this case, one liter of water (weighing about 1 kilogram) creates 1,700 liters of steam, as the water molecules spread out when they change into their gaseous form.	This is possible because liters is a measurement of volume, and a gas (or steam) can expand to take up whatever volume is available to it (the entire chimney). What stays the same is the mass / weight: 1 liter of water weighs 1 kilogram, and if you capture all the steam into a balloon, that'll also weigh exactly 1 kilogram. But the balloon with steam will be much more inflated (a lot more liters) than a balloon with 1 kilogram of liquid water. The quantity (1 kilo, 3 pounds, etc. ) stays the same, but gases can expand into as much volume space as you give them.

"The ""sparks effect"" in shows like power rangers and kamen rider is achieved through pyrotechnics. Small explosive charges, called squibs, are attached to the actors' costumes or props.

"An electron cannot be in the exact same location as a proton, but it can be very close or inside the nucleus of another atom, due to the properties of quantum mechanics. Let's break down this concept using the analogy of a cloud to help understand the behavior of electrons around atomic nuclei. In the atomic world, electrons don't follow precise paths like planets orbiting the sun. Instead, they exist in areas around the nucleus called ""electron clouds"" or ""orbitals,"" where they have a higher probability of being found. These clouds are like regions of denser air in an otherwise thin atmosphere. The electron's position is not fixed within this cloud; it moves around in ways that are described by quantum mechanics. Now, imagine that the electron cloud represents a denser air mass, and the proton represents a hot air balloon. The hot air balloon (proton) and the dense air mass (electron) can't occupy the same space, but they can come very close to each other. This is similar to the behavior of electrons and protons in an atom; they might come very close, but they never actually overlap in position. As for the question about an electron being ""trapped"" inside another atom's nucleus, electrons can indeed be found extremely close to or even within the nucleus of another atom. This phenomenon occurs during nuclear reactions and other atomic processes. For example, in a process called ""electron capture,"" a proton inside the nucleus captures an electron, which leads to the formation of a neutron. However, even though the electron can be found close to or within the nucleus, it doesn't necessarily get ""trapped. "" electrons are constantly moving and interacting with their surroundings, so they don't stay in one place for long. The forces between particles, along with the rules of quantum mechanics, govern how electrons move and where they can be found. In summary, electrons don't have fixed locations and cannot be in the exact same place as a proton. However, they can be very close to or within the nucleus of another atom, without necessarily being trapped inside it. Understanding these interactions is essential for the study of atomic and nuclear physics, and they play a crucial role in many natural phenomena."	"The answers are ""yes"" and ""no"" respectively. In fact, the most likely single place to find the first electron in an atom (the electron in its 1s orbital, technically speaking) is inside the nucleus itself, although it is still more likely overall to be outside the nucleus (because even though each point in the nucleus is more likely, there are far more points outside of it). And no, it isn't ""trapped"" inside. One of the key ideas of quantum mechanics is that particles ""want to spread out"", and that you need progressively stronger pulls to pull them into tighter and tighter spaces. So the 1s orbital, described above, is a sphere that is most concentrated at its center and extends, with progressively lower probabilities, out to infinity. If you made the nucleus more positively charged, the orbital would contract, because there'd be a stronger pull towards it, but it would still be spread out. To trap the electron fully, you'd need an infinitely strong pull. -----the everyday idea that two things can't be in the same place at the same time does not apply to particles the way it applies to objects. The quantum-mechanical version of this is that two fermions (a type of particle that includes protons, neutrons, and electrons) cannot be in the same *state* at the same time, where ""state"" includes things like the particle's energy level and which type of particle it is, in addition to its position. The solidness of everyday objects is ultimately the result of the electrons in the molecules that make them up being forced into higher energy levels as their locations start to overlap. They want to go back to lower energy levels, so this produces a resistance to compression called [degeneracy pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degenerate_matter) which, along with electric repulsion between electrons forced close to one another, is why solids resist compression."

The rico laws, short for racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act, are federal statutes created to combat organized crime. These laws focus on targeting and punishing a group for engaging in illegal activities, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, or extortion, as a part of an ongoing criminal enterprise. Instead of going after individual criminal acts, rico laws allow law enforcement to target the leaders of a crime organization for the actions of their group, in order to dismantle it completely.	Let’s say were in a mafia family. You’re the boss, and you order me to kill somebody or extort a politician. Before rico, conspiracy charges were shaky and it would’ve been hard to convict you. Only I would go to jail since I committed the crime. After rico, you can be charged too - because you were part of the criminal enterprise. No longer were prosecutors required to charge individuals one at a time, they could bring down entire organizations.

I've always wondered about this question if an employee is hired using at will terms which generally means ""at-will employment means an employer can fire an employee for any reason (providing the reason isn’t illegal), without warning and without having to disclose just cause for doing so."". Why do a lot of employers say that they have to make a case to fire someone when at will employment states they could fire them for any reason as long as it isn't an illegal one?"	Employers build a case for firing at-will employees to protect themselves from potential lawsuits. While at-will employment allows termination for any non-illegal reason, being able to provide evidence of poor performance, misconduct, or other valid reasons minimizes the risk of wrongful termination claims. Additionally, a well-documented case can assist with unemployment insurance disputes and maintain a consistent termination process, ensuring fairness within the workplace.	Because they need to prove that it is a legal reason and not an illegal one. If the employee could make any kind of case at all that it's an illegal reason they could end up with fines or court costs that are unpredictable and expensive. Dealing with an employee that's less than ideal in their eyes isn't the best situation from their perspective but is predictable and manageable

"""legitimate interest"" in the context of cookie settings refers to the justification a website owner has for collecting and processing your personal data, even without obtaining your explicit consent. It is one of the legal grounds that website owners can rely on for using cookies under the general data protection regulation (GDPR), which is a set of rules to protect user privacy in the European union. Imagine you're walking into a store. The store owner can monitor the number of customers walking in and out, and they can also take note of products that visitors are interested in. This helps them make decisions about the layout and what products to stock. In the digital world, cookies serve a similar purpose. They help website owners analyze visitor behavior and improve their user experience and services based on the data collected. Now, a key feature of GDPR is that it requires websites to ask for user consent before using cookies to process personal data. However, there are certain cases where obtaining consent might not be necessary, and ""legitimate interest"" comes into play. For example, a website may use cookies to prevent fraud or ensure network and data security. In this case, the website owner has a legitimate interest in processing user data without asking for permission, because it protects both the website and its visitors from harm. Another example could be the use of cookies to ensure proper functioning of a shopping cart on an e-commerce website. In this instance, the legitimate interest is providing the user with a working shopping cart to complete their purchase. Keep in mind that ""legitimate interest"" is not a free pass for websites to use cookies without restrictions. They must still balance their interests against the rights and interests of their users. Moreover, they should only use personal data when it is necessary for achieving the purpose they have in mind, and when there are no alternatives that are less intrusive to user privacy. So, to sum up: ""legitimate interest"" means that a website owner has a valid reason to use cookies without asking for the user's consent, as long as it helps achieve a specific purpose that is beneficial for both the website and the user, and respects user data privacy rights."	Legitimate interest is probably the most confusing of the grounds for using your data, because it's so wide. The basic idea is actually pretty simple. A legitimate interest is kind of like something that’s normal and expected for an organisation to do, and is either important or of minimal impact to people's privacy. For example, where I work we use legitimate interest as a reason for carrying out customer satisfaction surveys. It’s not essential for the service, but it’s a normal and unsurprising thing for a company to do. A website might do the same with regards to collecting data to improve the performance of the site. There’s been a shift in the last couple of years so that companies regards doing all sorts of advertising-related things with your data as normal and expected and thus a legitimate interest. To be classed as a legitimate interest, the impact on the individual has to be minimal, or there has to be a compelling reason for using the data in this way. Organisations should also consider whether there’s a better way to meet their objectives, and if it would be better to ask the customer’s consent instead. Legitimate interest is a useful ground for an organisation because you don’t need to actively ask for someone’s permission. They have to be able to opt-out, but not opt-in. Now you might be asking “why do sites often ask me both for consent *and* legitimate interest on the same things? ” i’m not sure there is a good reason for this. It’s not required by data protection laws, and I think it’s against the spirit and possibly even the letter of the law. The reason, as far as I can tell, is to make it harder for you to opt out of a company using your data how they want, because you have more options to go through.

E-fits, or electronic facial composites, are digital images created to help identify suspects in criminal investigations. They are constructed by combining different facial features based on the eyewitness's description of the suspect. The process starts with an interview between the eyewitness and a trained police officer or forensic artist. The officer uses specialized software, which contains a database of various facial features, such as eyes, noses, mouths, and hairstyles. The eyewitness selects the features that best match their memory of the suspect's appearance. Once the initial facial composite is created, the officer and the eyewitness work together to refine the image. They may adjust the size, shape, and position of features to improve accuracy. The final e-fit is then used to aid police investigations, typically by sharing with the public and other law enforcement agencies, in the hopes of identifying the suspect.	"""back in the day"" witnesses to a crime would get their statements taken by the police who would have a sketch artist on staff. This sketch artist would question the witnesses about what the suspect looked like, doing their best to draw their interpretation of what the descriptions meant to convey. They would go back and forth with the witnesses until the best representation of what they remembered was produced. This was, umm... ""hit or miss"" to be charitable. An e-fit is doing basically the same thing but instead using a computer program to form a composite image instead of a human sketch artist. Variations on a face can be shown to witnesses to quiz them on which appear to be closer to the suspect and gradually hone in on a better image to recognize them at large."

Voice recordings can be used in court, but there are specific rules and conditions that must be met for them to be considered admissible as evidence. These requirements are in place to ensure that the recordings accurately represent the voices and events they capture, and to protect people's privacy and rights. First, the recording must be relevant to the case. It must provide valuable information that can help the judge or jury make a decision. If the recording doesn't offer any useful insight, it won't be allowed in court. Second, the recording must be authentic. This means that it shouldn't be tampered with or altered in any way. The court will typically ask for proof of the recording's authenticity, such as the date and time it was made, the device used, or any witnesses who can vouch for its accuracy. Third, the recording must comply with any consent or privacy laws. In some jurisdictions, it's illegal to record someone without their knowledge or consent. If the recording was made without the proper consent, it might not be admissible in court. Lastly, the recording should be clear and understandable. If the audio quality is poor or the voices are unintelligible, the court may consider the recording unreliable or irrelevant to the case. So, voice recordings can be used against you in court if they meet all the	"The way the courts in the US are set up. Basically anything that a witness on the stand can not talk about from first hand experience is hearsay.

But basically anything at issue has to be something that the other side in a court case can ask a witness about. You can cross-examine an voice-mail. In addition to that there are rules that vary from state to state about your ability to secretly record people. In some places everyone on the recording must have agreed to be recorded in other places only one side need to have known.

Eminent domain is the government's power to take private property for public use, but it requires just compensation. This protection comes from the fifth amendment to the US constitution, which states that no person may be deprived of property without due process of law. Providing compensation and following necessary procedures ensures fairness and prevents potential abuse of power. In the past, land may have been taken without compensation due to weaker legal protections, but modern laws now prioritize protecting individual rights and property.	The fifth amendment protects against that in the USA. One thing to remember is that liberal thought (which is what western countries still mainly follow) is based strongly on the principle of land ownership. For those in the 17th century onward, there was no greater element of personal freedom than having full dominion over your land. The idea that the government could steal it without good reason and without paying you was one the worse sin someone could commit.

"The phrase ""you have the right to remain silent"" is part of the miranda warning, a crucial aspect of u. S. Law enforcement procedures. This warning is given to inform individuals of their rights under the fifth amendment of the u. S. Constitution when they are being arrested or interrogated. The fifth amendment protects individuals from self-incrimination, meaning they cannot be forced to provide information or testimony that could potentially be used against them in a criminal trial. By informing individuals of their right to remain silent, law enforcement officers are ensuring that any statements given by the suspect are voluntary, preventing the unintentional violation of their rights. A key case regarding these rights was miranda v. Arizona (1966), in which the u. S. Supreme court decided that any statements made by a suspect during an interrogation are admissible in court only if the suspect was made aware of their rights under the fifth amendment. This decision led to the development of the miranda warning, which includes other important rights, such as the right to an attorney. In summary, cops say ""you have the right to remain silent"" to ensure suspects are aware of their rights protected by the u. S. Constitution, helping prevent self-incrimination and ensuring any statements made by the suspect can be legally used in court."	They have to before asking any interrogation questions. It lets the suspect know that they don't *have* to answer anything and can remain silent instead. This is part of the miranda warning established in 1966. A man named ernesto miranda was accused of rape, and was never advised of his right to remain silent or have an attorney present during questioning. The police had him sign a confession statement, and signed a statement that said he was advised of his rights (he wasn't). They used the signed confession at trial and miranda was convicted of rape and sentenced to prison. His defense attorney took the case to the supreme court eventually. They overturned the conviction and established what we now know as miranda warnings/rights. The rest of the warning advises the suspect that they also have a right to have a lawyer present. And that if they can't afford one, a lawyer will be provided for them. And that they can choose to exercise these rights at any time. If police/detectives don't make this clear before questioning, they've broken the constitutional rights of the accused. And any evidence coming from the questioning may be thrown out during trial.

However, there are several ways in which courts ensure the integrity and reliability of photographic evidence. Firstly, the authentication process plays a crucial part in ensuring a picture's validity. When a photograph is presented in court, the person who took the picture or someone familiar with the scene it depicts must testify that the picture accurately represents the subject at the time it was taken. This process establishes the authenticity and accuracy of the photograph, serving as an assurance that any alterations have not influenced the overall presentation of the scene. Another method to determine a photograph's reliability involves examining the metadata, which is information embedded within the image file itself. Metadata can provide details such as the date and time a picture was taken, the camera model used, and sometimes even the GPS location where the photo was captured. By analyzing this metadata, experts can verify whether the photograph has been tampered with or not. However, it is essential to recognize that metadata can also be manipulated, so it alone is not a definitive way to establish a photograph's authenticity. Furthermore, digital forensics experts play a significant role in the investigation of images that are suspected of being manipulated. Through various techniques, these experts can detect inconsistencies and alterations in images, such as the presence of unusual patterns or lighting discrepancies. In some cases, sharing an original, unedited version of the image could also support the reliability of the photo evidence. In addition to these methods, it's important to remember that altering photographs in a manner that would influence a court's decision carries legal consequences. Presenting falsified evidence can lead to severe penalties, including criminal charges, which serve as a deterrent for those who may consider tampering with photo evidence. Finally, it's worth noting that courts are increasingly aware of the potential for image manipulation, and they carefully scrutinize photographic evidence accordingly. Judges and jurors are educated on the risks and limitations of using photographs in court and are instructed to weigh such evidence alongside other forms of proof, such as witness testimonies and physical evidence. In summary, while it is becoming easier to alter pictures with advancing technology, multiple safeguards are in place to ensure the authenticity and reliability of photographic evidence in court. These methods include the authentication process, metadata analysis, digital forensics, the deterrent of legal consequences, and increased awareness among court officials to scrutinize photographic evidence carefully.	The general rule is that no piece of “real evidence” gets admitted unless a person takes the stand and testifies under oath what it is and where it came from. Sometimes it requires more than one witness to do that. For example one witness finds the gun. Another witness tests the gun and matches it to the bullet. A third witness says “yeah i’m the guy who sold that gun to the accused. ”photographs are no different from any other piece of evidence. Somebody has to show when it was taken. That might just be a person testifying “yes I took that photo of the accused pointing the gun at the deceased moments before I heard the gunshot. ” for things like security footage from a bank, it’s a bit more complicated. A photo can be tampered with, just as the gun, or the examination can be tampered with, or the bullet, or anything else. But when a person takes the stand to say “i took that photo and it accurately shows what I saw”, then it is going into evidence. If the other party wants to argue that it has been tampered with, then they can go ahead and do so. But whatever they do, that only goes to the evidence’s value, not its admissibility. All evidence is subject to “weight”, as in how reliable is this piece of evidence. That is for the judge or jury to decide. But it’s worth knowing that there are few pieces of real evidence that are less reliable than most humans who take the stand and testify as to what they saw. We still allow people to take the stand and give their evidence, despite knowing that you can’t really completely rely on it. I’ve been a lawyer for 27 years. I have seen things that would make you shake your head, and i’ve been the witness (not literally, I never had to testify) whose memory was just plain wrong. It’s just shocking how the mind can screw up in an emotionally charged situation. We all do the best we can despite all the frailties, and most of us look forward to the things that will help us do it better. But boy oh boy, we all have some pretty good stories about evidence that let us down.

"Sexual assault is one of the hardest crimes to prosecute because it often boils down to a ""he said, she said"" situation. In many cases, there is a lack of physical evidence or witnesses, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault occurred. One issue is that victims may not report the assault immediately, due to fear, shame, or confusion. This delay can result in the loss of crucial evidence, such as dna or injury documentation. Additionally, the traumatic nature of the event can affect a victim's recollection, which may create inconsistencies in their testimony. Furthermore, societal biases may influence a jury's decision, particularly if they doubt the credibility of the victim or blame them for putting themselves in a vulnerable situation. These factors make securing a conviction for sexual assault more challenging compared to other crimes with clearer physical evidence or witness accounts. Finally, the stigma associated with sexual assault may lead victims to avoid reporting it altogether, further reducing the cases that are pursued in court."	One of the biggest factors in a case like that is whether or not the victim consented, and that can be incredibly hard to prove without any physical evidence of resistance. Sexual assaults don't generally happen in a public area with lots of witnesses who can say for sure the victim wasn't interested in the perpetrator. Usually they happen behind closed doors, or in an out of the way place where no one would catch them in the act. But the same can also be said about consensual sex acts. While many victims can, and do, fight back leaving physical marks on their attacker, these heal over time and unless the suspect is caught before that happens, you'll never know they were fought against. This means a sexual assault case ends up being one persons word against another. As a rule, courts tend to avoid throwing a potentially innocent person into jail even if that means a criminal goes free, so the case gets dismissed.

You could easily say that you never actually signed it and it would be nearly impossible to prove otherwise.	That is why we have witnesses and things like notary publics. If a document is important enough that both parties want to make sure there is no argument about whether or not it was properly signed, then they make sure it is recognized by a notary public and witnesses.	A signature serves as evidence of your agreement to the contract's terms. In case of disputes, technologies like handwriting analysis and digital forensics can often verify if a signature is genuine. However, it's crucial to have witnesses or use notary services to further strengthen the contract's validity.

It's just a method of structuring your answer. It's not a specific 'type' of answer. **issue**: state the legal issue in the problem that needs to be addressed (did this person commit assault). **rule**: what are the legal rules applicable to this issue (the criminal code defines assault as 'without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly. ' this case law about assault says x y z things). **analysis**: apply the rules you identified to the fact scenario of your particular case / problem. **conclusion**: state your determination. This accused did / did not commit assault based on the above analysis. Irac is not a *kind* of analysis its just a cohesive way to structure *any* legal analysis that is clear and concise.	IRAC stands for issue, rule, application, and conclusion. It's a method used to structure legal analysis by breaking it down into four organized steps, making it easier to understand and follow. 1. Issue: identify the central question or problem you're trying to solve. This is like figuring out the main puzzle you need to put together. 2. Rule: determine the legal rules or principles that apply to the issue. These are like the pieces of the puzzle that you'll use to create a clear picture. 3. Application: apply the rules to the facts of the case, explaining how they fit together. This step is like fitting the puzzle pieces to see how they connect based on the picture you're trying to create. 4. Conclusion: summarize the outcome, stating how the application of the rules to the facts leads to a resolution of the issue. In the puzzle analogy, this is stepping back and admiring the completed picture.

Squatting becomes harder to remove because it involves residency. Trespassing is a temporary invasion of property, while squatting is the unauthorized occupation of someone's property. Laws are designed to protect tenants from unfair eviction, making the process to remove squatters lengthy and complicated, as it often involves proving they aren't legitimate tenants.	"Often, squatters claim to be residents, maybe even claim they have a lease even if they say they can't find it. All you need is one piece of mail with your name and the address that you occupy. Now you're no longer trespassing, you're a ""tenant"" and need to be evicted."

Meaning, suppose a 3 letter agency (or as some like to say, the alphabet boys) collect information and data, is there an **external** branch of government that audits and controls access to this data? Meaning is there someone else besides say the cia/nsa that controls and keeps track of changes to these files? Otherwise wouldn't every foia request be based on just trusting that the information being provided by these agencies is reliable and not misleading?	In the US, the freedom of information act (FOIA) allows citizens to request access to federal agency records. Each agency is responsible for maintaining and tracking their own records, including any changes made. There isn't an external branch that audits or controls this data. Instead, agencies have designated foia officers who handle requests and ensure compliance with the law. While this system relies on trust in the agencies to provide accurate information, there are legal repercussions for noncompliance. Additionally, independent organizations and journalists can cross-check the released information against other sources to verify its accuracy and reliability.	"There is no outside agency. It would be redundant. Yes, it would be an outside department. But at the end of the day it would still be the government looking at its own materials and then telling you ""yes, this is accurate. You can trust me. ""trying to have an outside agency control or validate every single file generated by every government office would be an exercise in futility. There is too much stuff. Government orgs will have a department for foia requests, but their only real purpose is to make sure that information and documents released are covered by foia. Meaning they aren't private employee info or classified."

I'm sure there are tons of different types and specialities. Why do you only see advertisements for injury lawyers?	Injury lawyers, or personal injury lawyers, are common in advertisements because they work on a contingency fee basis, meaning they earn a percentage of the amount awarded to their clients. This makes advertising their services more lucrative, as it generates a higher number of potential clients and larger payouts for wins. In contrast, other types of lawyers usually work on an hourly rate or flat fee, making their income more predictable and less reliant on seeking new clients through advertisements.	That field of law has the most potential for a lawyer to get a big payday. The cases are often going after businesses or organizations that either have deep pockets or good insurance coverage. Basically, the potential for a case to pay well for a lawyer makes advertising worth the expense. It’s possible that just one or two clients that came to them each month could more than cover the cost of advertising. That’s made up numbers but you get the idea. Edited because auto-correct is my eternal frenemy.

In general, there isn't a specific law that prevents you from living in the wild, but there are various regulations and restrictions you need to consider. First, you must ensure that you're not trespassing on private land, which could lead to legal issues. Secondly, many wilderness areas are protected by the government, and some may have restrictions on camping, hunting, or gathering resources. Additionally, you may need permits for activities such as fishing or hunting. It's also important to consider local, state, and federal laws related to waste disposal and sanitation in order to protect the environment. In summary, while there isn't a direct legal barrier preventing you from living in the wild, you must comply with various regulations to avoid legal complications.	>eli5 is there anything legally stopping me from living in the wild? Depending on where you live you will: - be legally required to at all times have a valid postal address/a registered place of residence - not be able to camp on or even *enter* private property, whether it's farm- or woodland - not be able to camp on public property unless it's a designated camp ground- no be able to hunt or harm any wildlife without a hunting permit or even hunt or harm any wildlife **with** a hunting permit if it is not the appropriate hunting season for that wild life - be required to make regular contributions to a social security or pension system, regardless of your living arrangement

If the prosecutor of a criminal case refuses to charge anyone unless there is a witness who can testify to criminal intent, what happens then if the only witness is the attorney of the suspected perpetrator? Does attorney-client privilege still apply?	Attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney. However, if the attorney witnesses criminal intent, the privilege may not apply, as it generally doesn't cover observations by the attorney that are independent of their legal advice. Each case may vary depending on specific circumstances.	You would have to ask an attorney for the specifics #notlegaladvicebut in general no, an attorney cannot be asked to testify against their own client otherwise the legal system would break down. In many jurisdictions attorney's can testify but only with the written consent of the client.

How do some lawyers make such a difference in the outcome of a trial when defending clients accused of crimes? The evidence is the same regardless of the lawyer, so it doesn’t seem like they should have that much power over the verdict.	A renowned lawyer can make a difference in a trial by using their expertise in interpreting and presenting evidence, persuasive communication skills, and extensive knowledge of the law. They have a knack for creating compelling narratives, finding legal loopholes, and discrediting opposing arguments. Additionally, their reputation may create a sense of credibility and trust, making their arguments more convincing to the jury. Overall, their experience and skills can significantly impact the trial's outcome.	Well, larger lawyers often have access to more resources. They can devote multiple people to researching the case. Finding evidence, witnesses, or just combing through mountains of case law to find some case to support their case. That stuff exists for both sides, but if you have a single lawyer versus the guy that has several lawyers and a small team on interns the latter is just going to be able to churn through more info.

Isn't that censorship?	The main difference between censorship and redaction is the purpose behind them. Censorship involves suppressing or altering information to control public perception, often for political or moral reasons. Redaction, on the other hand, is the removal of sensitive or confidential information from documents before they're released publicly to protect privacy, security, or legal concerns. While both involve withholding information, redaction serves a specific, legitimate purpose, whereas censorship is generally seen as an oppressive control measure. In government documents, redactions are meant to protect individuals or secure information while still providing transparency.	"Censorship is usually about the government forcing *other* people (like television channels or book publishers) to remove information from their media. For instance, in Russia, journalists are being jailed for writing bad things about the war and government. That is censorship. Or sometimes it could be something outright silly (like not being allowed to show ghosts in movies or show other countries in a good light or really anything you can think of). Redaction is when someone... self-censors, in a way. They are saying, ""I will include this information but not that information""."

So we hear a lot about how countries like Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc. use slave labor because people from Africa, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or whatever come over to work and then they live in horrible conditions and their employers steal their passports so they can't leave. How does this stop anyone from leaving?	"In cases of ""modern-day slavery,"" employers confiscate worker's passports to limit their freedom and control them. While it's true that people can get emergency passports from their embassies, there are various factors that can make it difficult for these workers to access their embassy, such as distance, finances, fear, or lack of knowledge. Also, the worker's home countries might not have strong enough systems to efficiently provide help or may even neglect their citizen's predicaments. For some countries, their economy relies heavily on remittances sent home by expatriate workers, which may lead to them overlooking cases of worker abuse. Moreover, the worker might feel afraid to seek help from their embassy due to fear of losing their job or facing repercussions from their employer. The combination of these factors prevents some people from obtaining emergency passports and returning home, thus trapping them in a cycle of exploitation."	"It's fine if you are prepared. If you are unprepared how do you prove that you are who you are without a passport which may be your only form of id at the time? It's not an insurmountable challenge, but proving who you are from scratch is a problem even when you aren't in a different country. Being abroad makes it harder. Like at one point at a company I worked for when we sent people to sa for contract repairs to some of our equipment it was non unexpected that someone might take their passport ""till the job is done"" our guys were instructed to make sure to never have their driver's license and passport in the same place, let them have the passport, work the day then immediately go to the embassy and go home instead of sticking around."

If they're 'innocent until proven guilty' I dont understand why they are confined. I thought there was a right to a speedy trial also or is that not really the case?	"People spend long periods in jail awaiting trial due to several factors, such as overloaded court systems, difficulty scheduling, and delays for gathering evidence. While ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a fundamental principle, many individuals cannot afford bail or are considered flight risks. The right to a speedy trial exists, but various factors, like legal maneuvering and requests for delays by either party, can extend the process. These combined elements can result in long waiting times before a trial occurs."	Like any chokepoint in a system, too much going in for the processing function. Think queing for a haircut. You can reduce the amount going in, increase the processing function, or cut back the process. Cutting back the service is cheapest. In a barbers you could offer buzzcuts only via one chair. In justice this means pleading out. Reducing the customers would mean decriminalising offences, or reducing reoffending. More barbers would mean more courts. The first is politically expensive, the latter also expensive by raising taxes.

De jure refers to something that exists by law or officially, while de facto refers to a situation that exists in reality, even if it's not legally recognized. For example, a de jure government is the legally established authority, whereas a de facto government is one that effectively controls a region, regardless of its legal status.	De jure means how things are according to the lawde facto is how things actually arefor example, many nations are de jure democracies, but the de facto state of affairs means that the ruling party is unopposed and the people have no real ability to effect political change.

"""not charged but read in"" means that a defendant, while not officially charged with a crime, admits it as part of a plea agreement. This allows the judge to consider that crime during sentencing without going through the process of convicting them for it. It's often used as a negotiation tool between prosecutors and defendants, allowing the defendant to avoid additional charges or trial, while ensuring the crime is acknowledged in the legal process."	If it’s a plea agreement, the da likely agreed to dismiss charges or amend charges to lesser offenses in exchange for the defendant agreeing to plead guilty (or no contest) to a charge or charges. A plea agreement can specify that the dismissed charges be “read in” at sentencing, which allows the judge to consider the charges in the sentence even though the defendant won’t plea on them or be prosecuted for them.

I find these concepts to be very similar sometimes the same. What's the difference?	Punishment is a consequence imposed by an authority figure to correct or deter unwanted behavior, like a teacher giving detention. Retaliation, on the other hand, is an act of getting back at someone for a perceived wrong, often driven by personal emotions or grudges.	Retaliation is motivated by vengeance; the goal is to make somebody suffer in return for an injury. Punishment is an artificial consequence designed to discourage a behavior. They're not mutually exclusive terms, and there are plenty of cases in which punishment and retaliation overlap.
339	78f20c26-fa31-413e-b87b-ef17ca2fea98.txt	Why are crimes only eligible for expungment 5 years after conviction and not after the incident?	Crimes are eligible for expungement 5 years after conviction rather than after the incident because the time frame considers the offender's actions during and after completing their sentence. This waiting period serves as a test of rehabilitation, allowing the justice system to assess the individual's behavior and ensure they have shown reform and are not likely to commit further offenses. It's important to evaluate someone's actions after being held accountable and serving their punishment rather than immediately after the incident. Ultimately, this rule helps strike a balance between offering a second chance to those who have genuinely reformed while maintaining public safety and reducing the risk of repeat offenses.	Well, if you aren't convicted there is nothing to expunge. It is also possible (even likely) that someone will be convicted significantly after the incident itself, and it would be pretty silly to have a crime be eligible to be expunged almost immediately after the conviction. In concept someone could still be undergoing punishment or penalty for a crime eligible to be expunged given sufficient delay on conviction! There is also the conceptual fairness to consider of people needing to keep a crime on their record for varying amounts of time depending on how long it took them to go to trial and be convicted. Taking a long time to be convicted shouldn't be rewarded with a shorter time of keeping it on the record.

It can be a threat, yes. But it also gives the government or hiring company additional capabilities and deniability; they can send in the pmc and disavow them, saying the people with guns aren’t US soldiers, just armed private contractors. Any negative consequences stick to the pmc, while the benefits (armed security/protection, intimidation, force projection) are quietly enjoyed by the hiring company/government.	Countries allow private mercenary companies like pmc wagner or blackwater because they provide specialized security and military services that a nation's own forces may lack. These companies can be cost-effective and offer flexibility. However, they might pose a threat to a nation's inner security and law enforcement if not properly regulated, as they operate outside the traditional chain of command and may prioritize profit over national interests.

A victim-less crime is an offense where no other person or property is directly harmed. It doesn't contradict the concept of being innocent until proven guilty. That statement means people are considered innocent unless proven guilty in court. In the case of victim-less crimes, like drug possession, the person is still charged and can be proven guilty through evidence. The difference is that there's no identifiable victim suffering because of the offender's actions, only potential societal consequences.	No. Innocent until proven guilty is a legal concept. If you are accused of a crime, you are presumed innocent until the state meets its burden in court. Until then, the court cannot impose any sentence on you, the jury can't assume that you're guilty, etc. A victimless crime is a crime where none of the parties involved were technically harmed. The go-to example is prostitution. It's illegal, but if both parties consented, then which is the victim?

Glocks are popular among law enforcement primarily due to their reliability, simplicity, and affordability. Although some people find glocks uncomfortable and believe them to be inaccurate, these pistols have a proven track record in various conditions and situations. Law enforcement agencies also appreciate the consistent trigger pull and low maintenance requirements of glocks, making them a reliable and cost-effective choice for officers in the field.	Tldr: glocks are straight forward, reliable, and cheap. Glock spent a great deal of money and effort wooing law enforcement into buying large numbers of their handguns at a discount, that's the real reason. But glocks are also simple in design, require little maintenance, and are very reliable. They have been losing a fair amount of market share in law enforcement lately though to sig and s&w.

These lawyers work together to offer expertise in various areas of law, like family law, criminal law, or corporate law. Clients can be individuals, businesses, or organizations needing legal advice, representation, or assistance in resolving disputes. Law firms can vary in size, from small firms with just a few lawyers to large, international firms with hundreds. Their primary function is to help clients navigate complex legal matters efficiently and professionally, ensuring their rights are protected and interests are served.	A law firm is a company which mostly provides legal services. They typically have one or more lawyers on staff as well as a number of paralegals. What a law firm can help with varies a lot though. Lawyers specialize at specific areas of law so a law firm usually only take on the jobs that they have lawyers for. However a law firm typically knows a lot of other lawyers in other firms so even if your job is not something they take on they will be able to send you in the right direction.

Why not same approach for both?	The difference in approach stems from the intentions behind drug use and gun use. Drug legalization aims to reduce harm by regulating quality and reducing drug-related crimes. This approach acknowledges that people will use drugs regardless of legality. In contrast, stricter gun control aims to reduce the potential harm from guns, such as accidental injuries and gun-related crimes. Proponents believe that reducing access to firearms can help prevent these incidents, while still allowing responsible gun ownership.	A lot of drugs are much more dangerous because they are unregulated. Illegal sources that produce them use toxic substitutes and fillers because they don't care about the health of the consumer, government regulated companies couldn't do that. On the other hand guns are just as lethal no matter if you get them legally or not. Also, an unstable individual might use drugs to at worse kill themselves, meanwhile guns can be easily used by them to hurt innocent

If that is the case (please let me know if it isn't) than why do british tabloids seems so much worse about publishing blatantly false and defamatory things about british public figures?	They do break the laws. There’s been many cases of people suing them. Prince harry recently won a libel case against one of them. You’ll often see retractions printed. The retraction is usually a small note on page 8 or something to take back a false accusation made on the front page.	British tabloids often avoid breaking libel laws by using strategic language, vague insinuations, and claiming the information is mere gossip or rumors. Additionally, public figures may choose not to sue due to high legal costs, fear of drawing more attention to the story, or doubts about winning the case in court.

Scenario: your country is actively engaged in a hostile takeover of another country or transition of power.	"Banning certain munitions during war is managed through international agreements called treaties or conventions, where countries agree on rules to regulate warfare. These agreements are created by negotiations between countries and signed by their representatives. Examples include the geneva conventions and the chemical weapons convention. While there's no ""world police,"" countries that signed these agreements are expected to adhere to the rules and hold their own forces accountable. Failure to comply can result in consequences such as international condemnation, sanctions, or even prosecution in an international court, like the international criminal court (icc). It's important to understand that these agreements rely on mutual cooperation and trust among countries, as well as shared values about limiting the suffering caused by war."	There is no one to militarily enforce such rules in combat, no, except in extreme cases (ie. The US may treat general nuclear weapon usage as a direct and imminent threat to itself even if it's not in the conflict, and may respond in kind). The laws of war are, in practicality, guidelines for how wars should be waged to minimize suffering, especially to civilians. However, more practically, they provide grounds for post-war targeting of people who are known to have broke such rules. If the winners (or even a third party) gets their hands on you, you may be charged in the international criminal court and face imprisonment by that body. This is ignoring other public opinion impacts, like facing personal sanctions or extralegal reprisals.

Consulates can intervene in certain situations, like if a citizen gets arrested, by communicating with local authorities and providing legal guidance. However, they have limited power and can't overwrite local laws, but they can offer support and resources."	Consulates for the most part do not intervene with the countries they are located in.

"""preponderance of the evidence"" is a legal standard used in civil cases to determine which side's argument is more convincing based on the available evidence. In legal matters, there are different levels of proof that must be met depending on the type of case. In criminal cases, the highest standard is ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which means the evidence presented must be so convincing that no reasonable person would have any doubt about the guilt of the accused. Civil cases, which deal with disputes between people or entities, have a lower standard called ""preponderance of the evidence. ""think of ""preponderance of the evidence"" like a scale: the evidence presented by each side is placed on the scale and whichever side's evidence weighs more is considered to have met the standard. This doesn't mean that one side has to prove their case beyond any doubt – it just means they must provide evidence that makes their argument more likely true than not. In other words, if the evidence shows a 51% likelihood that one party's argument is true (and 49% likelihood that the other party's argument is true), the party with the 51% likelihood would win the case. An example can help clarify the concept. Let's say two people, alice and bob, have a financial dispute about a loan that alice claims she gave to bob. Alice says she lent bob money but he never repaid it. Bob, however, claims that it was a gift and he doesn't need to repay the money. In a civil court, alice needs to prove her case by preponderance of the evidence. She might present documents like a written agreement or text messages discussing repayment to support her case. If the judge finds that it is more likely than not that the money was a loan, alice will win the case by meeting the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard. In short, ""preponderance of the evidence"" refers to the level of proof required to win a civil case. It means the evidence must be convincing enough to show that it is more likely than not that the party's argument is true."	"It's the least onerous standard for considering whether something is or is not true, or something did or did not happen, or someone did or didn't do something, etc. In a court case, generally a civil case (as opposed to a criminal case). It literally means whenever the factfinder needs to determine something and there's conflicting evidence put forth by the parties, the factfinder just needs to find that it is more likely to be x rather than not x. More likely means anything over 50%. For example, if a dispute comes down to one person saying ""x happened"" and another person saying ""something other than x happened"" the factfinder has to determine which person is more likely to be correct/telling the truth. And it can be a really, really close call - but in the end, even the slightest tilt toward one person's testimony as more likely to be correct than the other person's testimony carries the day by a ""preponderance of the evidence. ""compare this to two other common standards of evidence in American jurisprudence - ""clear and convincing"" and ""beyond a reasonable doubt. "" where ""clear and convincing"" is the standard, the party who bears the burden of proof has to show that their version is clearly and convincingly more correct than the opposing party's version. For ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" the party bearing the burden of proof has to eliminate all ""reasonable doubts"" that could exist in the opposing party's favor. Think of it as something like this:preponderance = 50%+ likelihood of being correctclear and convincing = \~70%+ likelihood of being correctbeyond a reasonable doubt = at least 90-95%+ likelihood of being correct (basically, only a very small possibility of being wrong based on evidence presented)"

For example: you can view some items on prime video in the US but it's ""not available in your country"" in another country."	"Licensing involves agreements between content creators and distributors, giving permission to use copyrighted material in certain territories, like countries. For example, prime video acquires licenses from content creators to stream movies or TV shows in specific countries. These agreements can vary, so content available in the US might not have a license to show in another country. Reasons can include cultural differences, or content creators selling licenses to different broadcasters/platforms in other countries to maximize profits. Thus, you could encounter the ""not available in your country"" message when you try to watch certain content."	Every country has its own laws, so if a platform wants to make something available to the whole world, they'd still need to get the appropriate license in every country individually. Sometimes, this will mean that they decide the market is not big enough and it's not worth the investment. Some countries have agreed on some parts of the process (for example the eu when it comes to safety regulations for food), but in general a global company needs to make sure to follow the laws of whatever country it sells its products in.

The main difference between common law and civil law lies in their sources, principles, and the way they are applied in legal systems. Common law, also known as 'case law' or 'judge-made law,' is a legal system that relies on precedents established by previous court decisions, while civil law, also known as 'code law,' is based on a comprehensive set of written laws, or codes, that outline all matters capable of being legally addressed. Common law originated in england and has been adopted by many countries, particularly those that were once part of the british empire. It is important to note that the term 'common law' can also refer to a specific body of unwritten laws, such as those that govern marriage and property, but in general, the term is used to describe the broader legal system based on precedents. In a common law system, when judges are faced with a legal dispute, they will look to previous, similar cases to determine how to interpret the law and apply it to the current dispute. These previous court decisions, known as precedents, form a significant part of the legal system. Judges must therefore follow precedents set by higher courts, which in turn ensures consistency and stability in the law. When no precedents exist, judges will decide the case based on their interpretation of existing laws and, in doing so, create a new precedent for future cases. This process is known as 'stare decisis. 'civil law, on the other hand, originated in continental Europe and is based on roman law. Countries that follow the civil law system include most of Europe, latin America, and parts of africa and asia. In a civil law system, comprehensive legal codes are designed to cover all areas of law, such as criminal, civil, and administrative law. These codes are the primary source of law, and judges are responsible for applying this written law to the facts of the case at hand. Unlike common law, judges in civil law systems are not bound by precedents from previous cases. Although they may consider past rulings as a source of guidance or persuasive authority, they are not required to follow them and can interpret the code in different ways. This allows for greater adaptability and flexibility in applying the law but may sometimes result in less predictable outcomes for similar cases. In summary, common law and civil law systems differ in their sources, principles, and application. While common law relies on precedents established by previous court decisions, civil law is based on a comprehensive set of written laws, or codes. Common law systems emphasize the importance of judicial interpretation and adaptability through precedent, whereas civil law systems prioritize consistency and predictability through the application of written codes. Both systems have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and many countries have incorporated elements from both systems to create a hybrid legal system.	Civil law is the modern incarnation of roman law; common law is the modern descendant of germanic, specifically anglo-saxon, customary law. During the Roman empire, the territories subject to Rome used— spoilers! — Roman law. When various barbarian nations took control of roman territory, they sometimes-did-sometimes-didn't continue to honor it. (as a rule of thumb, places closer to the mediterranean and lingering roman power tended to keep roman law, and farther-flung kingdoms imposed their customary law codes on the conquered lands.) these were two totally different law systems. You could, and people have, written books just doing a compare-and-contrast. But if I'm going to give you a one-step vibe check on the situation, it's this: roman law was strongly adapted to having a government, so it put a lot of stock in magistrates: judges and constables and officials of all kinds. Meanwhile, germanic law was about one person trying to get his peers to approve of him going after his rival, by publishing a complaint and winning a court case: suing one another. If you want a taste of what that might have been like, read some of the icelandic sagas, but keep in mind that they're not a contemporary factual account even of the events depicted: they're fictionalized family stories from a couple hundred years later, and often have a social-political agenda. But wait! I hear you say. If common law is germanic customary law, why is england and its colonies & dependencies the only place it's practiced? What about germanic customary law in, I dunno, *Germany? * or Scandinavia, or even France– weren't the franks germanic? And yes! Customary law persisted in those places into the modern (1500-present) era. In France, they actually had a stupid dual system, with french common law in the north, and roman civil law in the south. But that's a hint to the answer to your question:it was Napoleon! (it's always Napoleon. ) one of the key complaints that fed into the french revolution was France's stupid legal system. This isn't just me editorializing: everybody agreed the courts were a joke. So, from his position as first consul and later emperor, Napoleon oversaw a total overhaul of the french legal system along civil-law lines. And wherever he went conquering, he installed not-always-exactly-puppet-governments, using his law code. You might have thought that when Napoleon was finally defeated and all those countries gone back to their former rules, they'd go back to the old laws, too. But the thing is, the napoleonic code was *good,* and it wasn't just France's common law system that was a mess. Basically everybody kept the new system.

"Taking a baby to a fire department for ""anonymous"" adoption is possible through safe haven laws. These laws allow parents to safely and anonymously relinquish an infant at designated places, like fire stations or hospitals, without fear of prosecution. Instead of linking the baby to their birth certificate or parents' identities, a temporary identity is assigned, and the baby goes through the adoption process. The main goal is to protect newborns from abandonment and ensure they are taken care of safely and responsibly."	Not all people give birth at a hospital and get a birth certificate for the child. There are people who give birth at home. It's not common, but it happens. But also, the main idea is that if a child is left at the fire department is that the policy is not to look into the birth parent, because they want to encourage people who might otherwise let a child they don't want die, to have an option that they won't feel punished for using.

It means they are allowed to leave custody until their trial. The court requires the person to deposit money or property as a guarantee they will appear in court when required. The bail system allows the accused to prepare for their trial, maintain their employment, and support their family while presumed innocent until proven guilty during the trial.	>eli5 - if someone is released on bail does this mean they are guilty but haven’t been tried yet?

"The main difference between ""jointly liable,"" ""joint and severally liable,"" and ""severally liable"" lies in how responsibility for a debt or obligation is divided and enforced among multiple parties. In ""jointly liable"" situations, all parties share equal responsibility for a debt or obligation. They have to work together to fulfill it, and the responsibility doesn't fall on any one person more than another. For example, if two roommates are jointly liable for rent, they must collectively pay the full amount every month. ""joint and severally liable"" means that each party is responsible not only for their share of the obligation, but also for the entire obligation if others fail to meet their responsibility. If one roommate is unable to pay their share, the other can be held responsible for the full rent. ""severally liable"" indicates that each party is only responsible for their individual share of the obligation and can't be held accountable for others' portions. If one roommate doesn't pay, it doesn't affect the other's responsibility."	"Jointly liable means that two or more people or entities are responsible for fulfilling a legal obligation or responsibility. This means that if one party is unable to fulfill their obligations, the other party or parties may be held responsible for fulfilling the obligation. Joint and several liability, also known as ""joint and severely liable,"" is a legal doctrine that holds all parties who are jointly liable for a debt or obligation responsible for the entire amount. This means that each party is individually responsible for the entire debt, even if one party is unable to pay their share. Severely liable means that a person or entity is solely responsible for fulfilling a legal obligation or debt. This means that they are the only party who is responsible for fulfilling the obligation, and they cannot seek contribution from other parties who may also be responsible."

When the prosecution fails to prove guilt, that in itself is not proof of innocence. Therefore the court states that they are “not guilty” instead. Innocence is presumed.	"Courts use ""not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"" because their purpose is to determine if there's enough evidence to prove guilt. ""not guilty"" means there isn't enough evidence to convict, while ""innocent"" implies that the person is completely free of any wrongdoing."

Bail is a temporary release of an arrested person, requiring a payment to the court as a guarantee that they will show up for their trial. The amount is set by a judge based on factors like the severity of the crime and the defendant's criminal history. If the person attends all court dates, the bail money is returned, minus any fees. If they don't, they lose the money and are subject to arrest. Bail can be paid in cash, through a bail bondsman, or by providing collateral like property.	It is a condition of release and to ensure you appear for court. Example: you get arrested and the judge sets bond at $10,000 cash or surety. You can post the whole $10,000 to the clerk's office and get your money back when the case is over. Or, you can post through a bondsman who will make you pay a portion of the bond amount (typically 10%) and he will cover the rest. When your case is over, he gets his $9,000 back and keeps your $1,000.

"A prison sentence like ""life plus 25 years"" may seem confusing as you might think that a life sentence should already cover any additional time. However, there are several reasons for these types of sentences. First, a life sentence doesn't always mean that the person will be in prison for their entire life. In some jurisdictions, a life sentence may be eligible for parole after a certain number of years, like 20 or 25. If the person is granted parole, they will be released under certain conditions. Adding extra years to the sentence ensures that even if the person becomes eligible for parole, they will have to serve additional time before being considered for release. Second, the extra years can account for multiple crimes or offenses committed by the same person. For example, someone may be convicted of two crimes, one resulting in a life sentence and the other adding 25 years. This ensures that each crime is given its appropriate punishment. Lastly, these extended sentences can also be a deterrent for others. It sends a strong message that crimes will be taken seriously and punished accordingly, which can help discourage individuals from committing similar offenses."	The basic idea is that they keep track of different punishments for different crimes. If joe criminal was arrested for stealing a car, running over an elderly man and murdering him, and crashing the car into a preschool, each of those would be different crimes with different punishments. Let's say he got life in prison for running over the elderly man, and 25 years for crashing car into a preschool. But then, his lawyer later discovers that the elderly man wasn't killed by joe, but that the man's wife had already killed him and threw him in the path of an oncoming car to try and cover up her murder. He appeals, and the judge agrees that joe shouldn't get life imprisonment anymore since he didn't actually commit murder. That part of his sentence is removed, but he still has to do the 25 years for crashing the car into a preschool. So it's important to keep track of each punishment separately, in case of situations like this.

Over the last couple of years, more and more music artists have sold their music catalogs to (mostly) the big record labels. Bob Dylan, ZZ top, Justin Bieber, Bruce Springsteen, David Guetta, etc. But what happens to the artist's rights in regards to his/her future? Are they allowed to play their songs at concerts at least? What about future releases?	"When artists sell their music catalogs, they generally sell the rights to their past recordings and compositions. This means the buyer can profit from streaming, sales, and licensing of those songs. However, artists typically retain their ""performance rights,"" allowing them to continue performing the songs live at concerts without additional permission or fees. For future releases, the arrangement depends on the specific contracts. If the artist retains recording rights for new music, they can release and profit from new songs independently or with a new record label. However, if they sold future recording rights too, they would need to negotiate royalties or terms with the catalog buyer."	"It all depends on exactly what they sold and what went into the contract. In theory they could sell any combination of rights. They might be selling the entire catalog and all the rights that come with it, or it might just be a subset. For example, ""you can play and sell any of my songs you like, but I reserve the right to perform any of them live whenever I want. "" or ""you have full rights to everything I've written up to now, but no claim at all on anything I do in the future. "" like any contract, it's almost infinitely negotiable."

It's a technique of a company to avoid being bought by a competitor (defend against a hostile takeover)it works by selling your most valuable assets (your crown jewels) to another company that is friendly towards you. That way the hostile competitor can't make use of the company as important parts of it are missing. If they now also try to buy the new owner they can simply move the crown jewels further making it arbitrarily expensive to take actual control. This also drops the value of your companies shares, making it less attractive for speculative investors that just buy to sell again quickly.	"The crown jewel defense is a strategy used by companies to protect themselves from hostile takeovers. It involves selling or threatening to sell the most valuable assets (the ""crown jewels"") of the company, making it less attractive to the potential buyer. For example, imagine a company that owns several factories, but one factory is particularly profitable and valuable. If the company fears a hostile takeover, they could sell or create legal barriers to sell that valuable factory in the future. This would make the entire company less appealing to the potential buyer, as they would be missing out on the ""crown jewel"" that originally made it an attractive target."

Each sentence is given for a separate criminal act, and keeping the sentences distinct from each other allows the criminal acts to be considered independently. If a person is convicted of two separate murders, but is later exonerated of one of those murders, you want to be able to expunge one of two life sentences.	Multiple life sentences are given to ensure that serious offenders serve a long time in prison, even if some charges are overturned. It also serves as a strong deterrent and emphasizes the severity of the crimes committed. For example, if a person is found guilty of three crimes, a life sentence for each crime ensures they remain in prison.

Prosecutors making deals, retailers promising rebates, sellers on ebay, consumers taking out credit or loans, etc, etc. In every example, the reason you stick to your word is that your reputation is vital. Reneging even once could forever ruin it. After that, you'll never again be able to get a loan, or make a good bargain with a defendent, or sell on ebay, or whatever it is you lied about. For a nation, losing all diplomatic credibility erases your most important tool of statecraft. Relevent update, as of this morning: [putin says more prisoner swaps possible. ](https://politicalwire.com/2022/12/09/putin-says-more-prisoner-swaps-possible/)	In a prisoner swap between countries, trust is established through negotiations and agreements, often monitored by a neutral third party. These negotiations involve discussing the terms and conditions of the exchange, including the timing, location, and specific prisoners involved. For example, the red cross has often played the role of a neutral mediator in such situations. Once both parties agree on the details, they proceed with the exchange, usually at a predetermined neutral location. Any breach of the agreement can lead to diplomatic repercussions and a loss of trust between the countries, which is a strong deterrent for breaking the agreement. Consequently, governments typically uphold their end of the deal to maintain good international relations and their own credibility.

"The government primarily uses a combination of hunting regulations, licensing systems, and enforcement officers to ensure hunters stay within the ""bag limit"" during game-hunting season. First, each state sets specific hunting regulations, which include bag limits, defining how many animals of a particular species can be harvested by an individual hunter during a hunting season. Hunters must abide by these rules to maintain wildlife populations and promote sustainable hunting practices. Second, hunters are required to purchase licenses and tags for specific animals and species. Licenses keep track of the number of hunters and their allowed limits, while tags are used to mark the animals they've harvested. Hunters typically have to report their harvests, either online, in-person, or via phone, depending on the state's requirements. Lastly, enforcement officers, such as game wardens or wildlife officers, patrol hunting areas to monitor compliance and check for proper licensing and compliance with bag limits. While there is a level of trust in the honor system among hunters, these enforcement measures help maintain the wildlife populations and ensure that hunters adhere to the established rules."	I'm sure that this is not a universal system, but many places require tags. A tag is piece of paper that allows you to get certain animals. It's like a permit for a specific animal. During hunting season, you can apply to get a certain amount of tags. Depending the year, the government might allow anyone to go up to their personal limit in tags, or maybe they only issue a set amount of tags for everyone. Let's say you get two moose tags. This means that you are allowed two moose. When you shoot a moose, you attach the tag to the moose and fill in the date and time and sign it. If a government officer catches you with an animal without a tag, you can get booked for poaching. I'm sure that the tags have serial numbers, so you can't just photocopy them. You can't re-use tags because you have to date them when you first use them.

How can it be illegal?	In the UK, carrying a knife is illegal only if it's without good reason or context, like self-defense. Chefs can carry knives for work purposes, making it a valid reason. Packaging doesn't determine legality. Pen knives, if under 3 inches and non-locking, are considered legal to carry. However, misusing any knife can still result in legal consequences. The law focuses on circumstances, intent, and the type of knife involved.	If you have a valid reason for having the knife it's ok. If you've clearly just bought it, for example, it would likely be in some protective packaging. Second hand, you could purchase, but obviously you just have to be careful and not just walk around town with it. Pocketknives are ok as long as the blade is no longer than 3 inches, and isn't a flick blade/switch knife style knife.

"While Zorro is a public domain character, meaning his original stories are no longer protected by copyright and can be freely used, the name ""zorro"" itself can be protected by a trademark. The difference between copyright and trademark is important here. Copyright protects creative works, like books, movies, and songs. It typically expires after a certain period of time, allowing the works to enter the public domain, where anyone can use them for free. Public domain characters like zorro can be included in new stories without asking for permission from the original creators. On the other hand, a trademark protects a name, logo, or slogan associated with a product or service, to avoid confusion among consumers. Trademarks can be renewed indefinitely as long as they are being used in commerce. In the case of zorro, the rights holders have trademarked the name ""zorro,"" preventing others from branding their works with that name without permission. So, you can use the character of zorro in a story, but you cannot use the name ""zorro"" as a brand or title without permission from the trademark owner."	"Trademarks and copyrights are different things. A trademark is an image associated with a brand. It's a way to say who made a product or service. You only own a trademark insofar as you can prevent others from using the same trademark to pretend to be you, in the same industry you work in. And, in particular, **trademarks never expire** - as long as you are using the trademark as a symbol of your brand, you can continue doing so indefinitely. Copyrights are a stronger form of control over an image. They say ""i made this image and therefore control who can use it and for what"". Copyrights aren't limited to people doing business or competitors within your specific industry and you don't have to be using them to identify any sort of product of service. But copyrights do expire (albeit after a very long time; they have been extended many, many times in recent decades)."

However, not everyone is subjected to following human rights equally, and violations can occur by either individuals or through government actions.	"Human rights are rights that apply to every human, just because they are *human*. This is in contrast to other rights that only apply to a specific group, such as extra rights for citizens of a country. Of course, the concepts of human rights (or rights in general) is a human invention. So there is no objective list of what rights are human rights. Though the most widely recognized list is the [uns ""universal declaration of human rights""](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). As will all rights, they are only as good as they can be enforced. And enforcement varies drastically from ""non-existent"" to ""pretty good"""

"Giving your id to a US police officer is often seen as a problem or an objectionable activity because it raises concerns about individual privacy and potential abuse of power by the authorities. The main issue revolves around the principle that people should be free from unwarranted interference or scrutiny by the government. In the United states, the fourth amendment of the constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that, in most cases, the police cannot force an individual to identify themselves without a legal reason, such as probable cause to believe they have committed a crime. Some people view providing identification to an officer as an unnecessary intrusion into their personal lives and a violation of their privacy. There are concerns that this information could be misused, leading to racial profiling, harassment, or even false arrests in some cases. An analogy to this situation is when someone asks for your phone number in a social setting without a clear reason. It might make you uncomfortable to provide that information if you don't know who they are or why they're asking for it. Similarly, people might object to simply handing over their id to a police officer without understanding the purpose behind the request. To balance these concerns, some states in the US have ""stop and identify"" laws, which require individuals to provide their name when requested by a police officer, but not necessarily show their id. However, the rules and requirements vary by state, so it is important to know your rights in your specific location."	"It's objectionable because the US has a rich tradition of individual rights, specifically police have very specific and limited abilities to *force* you to do things. They can ask, and you can comply with their ask, but they often can't force you to do something unless they are ""detaining"" you, or ""arresting"" you. So certain groups of people might say, if I don't *have* to say/do anything for the police, I won't, it can only hurt you right? The classic example is the cop pulls you over while driving and asks ""do you know what I pulled you over? "" and you say ""yeahhhh, that tail light is out, sorry"" or ""i know, I know, I was driving too quickly"". The cop could have been feeling lonely, or wanted to see what your shirt said, but now you've confessed to offenses that you can be punished for. You should have either said nothing, or ""no, I don't actually. ""so in short, the only real answer to your question is because *you don't have to* and depending on your pov of how interactions with police go, you might believe doing the absolute bare minimum you are legally required to do for the police is the advisable course of action."

Provided they made the decision to charge everyone (18+ but under 21), how do they go about processing en masse?	In a situation where police decide to charge a large group of underage individuals at a college bar, they would likely follow a systematic approach. First, they would secure the area and safely gather all the individuals. Next, they would confirm the identities and ages of everyone present. They might do this by checking ids or driver's licenses. Then, officers would document each individual's information, and issue citations or any relevant charges. This process may involve coordinating with additional law enforcement officers to manage the large number of individuals and ensure a smooth and orderly process.	Police have a wagon, sometimes called the paddy wagon in the northeast because of the irish. They put a large group of people in the wagon, which is really a large van, and drive them to the station. Take them out one a time, do the paperwork, and either let them go or put them in a cell for the night. If there are lots of people they use more than one van, or call in the other departments. Sheriff offices handle prison transports and have the ability to move large groups securely.
375	6ff633cd-a07f-4232-85ac-9069ff4f322e.txt	States rights vs federal rights and which one has priority?	"States' rights and federal rights refer to the division of power between state governments and the federal government in the United states. In general, the federal government has priority over state governments due to the supremacy clause in the u. S. Constitution, which establishes federal law as the ""supreme law of the land. "" however, the balance of power is not absolute. The 10th amendment reserves powers not explicitly granted to the federal government for the states. This creates a system called federalism, which allows states to make their own laws in areas not controlled by federal law. Think of this like a parent (federal government) and a teenager (state government). The parent sets rules for the household, but the teenager has some freedom to make their own decisions within those boundaries. If the teen's choices conflict with the parent's rules, the parent's rules ultimately take precedence."	Generally speaking (just in theory, it gets murkier in practice) the federal government has jurisdiction over things which the constitution explicitly gives it jurisdiction over; interstate commerce and national defense are two examples. In these areas the federal government has the authority. For example, ohio can’t say that people from kentucky can’t ship goods into ohio because that’s interstate commerce. Everything not explicitly designated to the federal government by the constitution, such as education, waste collection, roads etc. Is supposed to be the domain of the states. In reality, we’ve had over two centuries of laws and court decisions that make this distinction way murkier than it probably was when the constitution was written, but that’s how it works in theory. Edit: and as other people have mentioned, the supremacy clause means that when the jurisdiction overlaps, the federal government overrules the state government.
376	10d56194-e5e1-4d60-adca-1d20edbab403.txt	How can someone be proven not guilty of murder in criminal court but still sued in civil court?	"In the legal system, there are two types of court cases: criminal and civil. Criminal cases involve a person being charged with a crime, like murder, by the government. Civil cases deal with disputes between individuals or entities, like suing someone for damages. The main difference between these two types of cases is the burden of proof. In a criminal case, the prosecution must prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the defendant committed the crime. This is a very high standard of proof because a person's life or freedom is at stake. In a civil case, the standard is lower: ""preponderance of the evidence,"" which means that it is more likely than not that the defendant was responsible for the damages. In other words, the evidence must show that it's more than 50% likely that the defendant is liable. So, when someone is found not guilty in a criminal case, it means that the prosecution couldn't provide enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed the crime. However, in a civil case, the plaintiff (the person suing) might be able to provide enough evidence to meet the lower standard, proving that it's more likely than not the defendant caused the damages. A famous example of this is the o. J. Simpson trial. In 1995, a jury found simpson not guilty of the murders of nicole brown simpson and ron goldman in a criminal trial. However, in 1997, he was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages to the victims' families. In summary, the key difference between criminal and civil trials is the standard of proof required. A person can be found not guilty in a criminal court due to the high burden of proof, but still be found liable for damages in a civil court because of the lower standard of proof."	"They are two entirely different systems of justice. Criminal court is a component of government. It is a process that is invoked by law enforcement. Its purpose is to determine if someone is *guilty of a performing a criminal act* and if so, impose fines, incarceration, or other negative responses that are intended to increase public safety, deter the criminal from re-offending, and deter others from doing what the criminal did. Civil court is a process that can be started by any private citizen by filing a law suit. *there may or may not be an actual and verified crime involved. * its purpose is to seek compensation or prevent further damage from someone who supposedly has 'unfairly treated' you (e.g. Sold and cheapened your own artistic works, or slandered your god name) or had a negative impact on your quality of life. Because they're different, they have different criteria for the other side ""winning"" a court action against you. For example, you can get off on a technicality in criminal court where someone screws up an important procedural component or there's inconsistencies in critical evidence. Or it turns out the wrong charge was levied against you, say murder when it was manslaughter. But escaping that conviction doesn't mean there was zero damage caused by your act. Families could lose their source of income if you were clearly involved in the loss of their breadwinner's life, and that family would experience the pain and stress of their death, even though criminal court didn't convict you. The bars for success are different because the system is different."

The main reason politicians take sensitive or classified documents away from their official workplace is to work on them in private or have discussions with other officials in a more secure setting. Sometimes, decisions need to be made or issues analyzed without distractions. To ensure the confidentiality of these documents, there are strict protocols they must follow when transporting them, such as using secure bags and having proper clearance. Despite the risks involved, politicians need access to these documents to make informed decisions on important matters, and taking them to a secure location can help facilitate this process.	They're not (usually) doing it maliciously. You have to remember that politicians are elected. They aren't background-checked. Their jobs aren't dependent on them following the rules. Federal employees with access to classified documents are routinely put through background checks and polygraphs. If they mishandle classified documents, they're likely to lose their livelihood. Since this isn't true to politicians, they just don't have the reverence or motivation to care for classified documents in the same way. They take the documents they need to suit their needs and current job, and then forget about them.

There is a lot of fear about Tiktok being malicious and the Chinese government getting data on citizens. I get the fear when it comes to people that have sensitive information but for the regular person what could a foreign government do with your data?	People fear foreign governments collecting data on citizens because it can lead to manipulation, identity theft, and blackmail. Even if you think you have nothing to hide, detailed information about you can be used to create targeted disinformation or propaganda. For example, if a foreign government knows your political views, they can send tailored content to influence your opinions. In addition, they could potentially use your personal information to impersonate you or exploit your vulnerabilities.	Market & voting manipulation - tapping into people's fears and wants to influence their actions (for example Germany prior ww2). This can be done with bots on social media (either impersonating a real person, or an army of bots 'liking' a specific post, faking it's popularity). High security espionage - tagging soldiers and politicians wereabouts (including where and when the transmission stopped). Blackmailing, specifically of people in power to get them do their bidding.

Fetal personhood laws grant legal rights to unborn babies, but the specifics can vary. If implemented, it could raise concerns about incarcerating pregnant individuals. However, it's likely that lawmakers would create exceptions or provisions to address these situations, such as specialized facilities or alternative punishments for pregnant convicts. The main goal of these laws is to protect the unborn from being harmed, not to restrict the legal process surrounding the pregnant person.	As best I understand the law, if you believe in fetal personhood laws, it means exactly what you want it to mean and absolutely nothing else, so there’s no problem there. The law would be kind of incoherent and hypocritical, and would be very selective about when and how fetuses had the same legal rights as people (and what that entitled them to), but that’s not inconsistent with general policy goals for fetal personhood advocates.
380	1eebb593-b7b3-4f7b-971a-3d6e16726e14.txt	Why do people require a license to own a firearm?	A firearm license is required to ensure that gun owners are responsible, educated, and capable of properly handling firearms. This helps reduce the risk of accidents, misuse, and crime related to guns. Licensing involves background checks, verifying eligibility, and sometimes requiring training courses on gun safety and laws. Similar to obtaining a driver's license, the process aims to keep the community safe by verifying that individuals using potentially dangerous equipment are qualified, informed, and adhere to relevant regulations.	We require a license to drive a car because of how dangerous a car can be if someone doesn't know how to use it is driving. They could get into an accident and kill people, damage buildings, and cause major problems. Many people feel that the same concept should also apply to guns. That someone who doesn't know what they're doing with a gun could cause people to die. There are people who believe that requiring licensing on guns isn't fair. But they tend to be in the minority.
381	756dedbf-5d6d-4ceb-b13b-99e72c5e38b3.txt	Why is prostitution illegal?	Prostitution is illegal in many places mainly due to societal concerns, ethical issues, and the potential for negative consequences. First, societal concerns stem from the idea that prostitution may be morally wrong or degrade the individuals involved. Some people believe that sex should only occur within certain relationships or under specific conditions. As prostitution often goes against these values, it is prohibited to maintain social norms and moral standards. Second, ethical issues arise when considering the potential for exploitation and violence. In many cases, individuals involved in prostitution may face manipulation, coercion, or human trafficking. By keeping prostitution illegal, authorities aim to protect vulnerable individuals from these harmful situations. Lastly, negative consequences include public health concerns and crime. Prostitution can lead to the spread of sexually transmitted infections and diseases, as well as unintended pregnancies. Moreover, prostitution is often linked to other criminal activities, such as drug use, violence, and money laundering. By making prostitution illegal, the government tries to minimize these risks. However, some countries have legalized or decriminalized prostitution in an attempt to better regulate the industry, protect its workers, and reduce associated crimes.	First off, it's not illegal globally. Plenty of European countries have legal prostitution, usually with various caveats and guidelines. I assume you mean why is it illegal in the US? A mixture of reasons. * anti-sex conservatives are definitely one reason, but it would be inaccurate to say they're the only reason. * concerns about human trafficking. The sex industry has a high prevalence of abuse, and some people feel that banning the sex industry entirely is important for public safeguarding* concerns about public health. This one is a thorny one, but some people claim sex work is inherently unhealthy. This is both on grounds of stis, as well as things like unwanted pregnancies. * concerns about antisocial behaviour. The idea that sex work is unpleasant to be around, and legalising it would make a given city less pleasant to live in, increase crime, etc. All of these points are debatable and can be argued multiple ways. This is why there is no general global consensus on the legality of sex work.
382	a07bb8a1-977f-46e4-9adc-d73a69cb9f3f.txt	When someone submits their own literature for publication, what prevents the publishing company from using it (or the idea) without permission? Do authors copyright their work before sharing it?	1. The law. Copyrights do not have to be registered ahead of time, as long as you have proof that you are the original author of the work. If the publisher copies your work, you can sue them and, if you can demonstrate in a court of law that you are the original author, you get the copyright and they get in trouble. Registering your copyright ahead of time is one method of getting ironclad evidence that you own it, but for most authors there should be plenty of evidence from drafts, notes, and edits that you made while working on it that you can show you have and the publishing company doesn't have, such that it would be a non-issue. 2. Reputation. If a publisher steals someone's work, that person will angrily tell everyone about it. Which, again, should be easy for the author to demonstrate as being true, which will destroy the reputation of the publisher and cause other authors and potentially customers to not want to do business with them. Publishers are typically large companies that have a lot of money at stake, so stealing one or two works is not worth the risk of destroying the entire company. It probably does happen from time to time, especially in countries with a low trust society, but I'm pretty sure it's not a frequent occurrence in the first world.	In most countries, copyright protection is automatically granted to an author when they create a new work, such as literature. This means that authors do not need to register their work beforehand or take any additional steps for it to be protected by copyright laws. The moment a piece of literature is written down or saved electronically, it is considered copyrighted. Publishing companies are held accountable by copyright laws, which protect authors against unauthorized use of their work, including reproduction, distribution, and adaptation without prior permission. Copyright infringement can lead to legal consequences such as fines, damages, and even criminal charges in severe cases. Publishers would not want to risk their reputation and face legal backlash for using an author's work without permission. Moreover, publishing houses usually have a series of agreements in place when working with authors. These contracts clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties. For example, they specify royalties for the author and the circumstances under which the publisher may use the work. This legal agreement helps ensure that authors are fairly compensated and their work is appropriately used by the publishing company. To summarize, authors automatically receive copyright protection for their work upon creation, and this prevents publishers from using their work without permission. Legal agreements between authors and publishers further clarify the terms of use and compensation, allowing authors to safely share their work for publication without concerns about copyright infringement.

It required schools to test students' skills in subjects like reading and math annually, and set targets for their progress. Schools that didn't meet these targets faced various consequences, such as restructuring or loss of funding. The goal was to boost educational quality by holding schools accountable for their students' success. While some praised it for setting clear standards, others argued it led to excessive testing and focused too much on punishment rather than support.	The idea was similar to naplan and obe here in Australia use a series of tests to determine which schools were underperforming academically, and assign resources on that basis (extra teachers, better facilities, whatever). What it resulted in was a. ) a massive bill to actually make improvements (multiple billions); and b. ) the fact that most of the schools / staff / facilities were already at their spending limits. The solution? Change the criteria. An f is now adjusted to a d. You don't need more money for teachers. Thank you for playing.
384	6d75f6d0-b49f-4118-b84f-5d23e38c94fb.txt	Why do agencies like the CIA declassify documents?	"The government can only mark information as classified if a) disclosing that information can reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, and b) the information relates to one of eight topic areas. Those areas are:1. Military plans, weapon systems, or operations. 2. Foreign government information. 3. Intelligence activities, sources or methods, or cryptography. 4. Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United states. 5. Scientific, technical, or economic matters relating to national security. 6. Programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities. 7. Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems relating to national security. 8. Development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. While recognizing the importance of keeping some secrets, the government also recognizes the need for transparency about government activities. To that end, information is automatically considered for declassification after 10 or 25 years, depending on its source. Citizens can also formally request a particular piece of information be declassified. In both cases, the agency first conducts a review to see if the information still needs to be protected. For example, ""military plans"" are automatically classified. This would include the plans for d-day, but the ship has (literally) sailed on our invasion of northern France. We can release those plans to the public without risking national security. On the other hand, the plans for capturing osama bin laden might reveal tactics, techniques, or procedures we still use to target terrorists around the world. If they got out, terrorists could use that information to make themselves harder to find and capture, so they need to stay secret for now. Overall, the goal of the classification process is to protect *as little* information as possible. It doesn't always work that way, but automatic and mandatory review help ensure the government isn't hoarding secrets ""just because. """	The main reason agencies like the CIA declassify documents is to promote transparency and public awareness about the government's activities, while also considering the need for secrecy to protect national security. First, let's understand what classified documents are. Governments and their agencies often work on projects or plans that are sensitive in nature, such as military operations or intelligence gathering. This information is often classified, meaning access is restricted to a small group of people with the necessary clearance. As time passes, the sensitivity of such information may decrease, allowing for its potential declassification. Declassification refers to the process of removing the restricted access and making the document available for public view. There are a few reasons why this is done:1. Transparency: in a democratic society, it is essential for citizens to have access to information about the actions and decisions made by their government. Declassification allows for better understanding of historical events and how decisions were made during that time, fostering an informed public. 2. Historical significance: many declassified documents hold significant value for historians and researchers. By making them available, it adds to the collective understanding of our past and helps in contextualizing the events that shaped our world. 3. Legally required: in the United states, for example, there is a law called the freedom of information act (foia) which allows citizens to request access to information held by the federal government. If a document is eligible for declassification under these laws, it can be released. 4. Security considerations: as time goes on, the risks associated with certain classified information may lessen, allowing for the documents to be declassified without risking national security. However, it's essential to balance the declassification process with the need to protect ongoing operations or individuals involved. Highly sensitive information, or any details that might still pose a risk, remains classified until the risk is deemed negligible. In summary, declassifying documents allows government agencies to promote transparency, enrich historical understanding, comply with legal requirements, and balance national security concerns as the sensitivity of certain information decreases over time.

It's something I was asked but don't know enough about.	"The entire point of a public company is that it's \*public\*... In return for access to the stock market, companies have to publish a whole bunch of data on a regular basis so that ""the public"" knows what's going on with the company and can make informed decisions about buying/selling the stock. If somebody knows something about the stock that ""the public"" doesn't, they can use that to trade ahead of the market. . . That results in distortion of the price because it means that not all the buyers and sells are working from the same information. Short version: it destabilizes the stock market and makes prices even more volatile than they are, and privledges some buyers/sellers over others when they're all supposed to be equal (in theory)."	Insider trading is illegal because it undermines the integrity and fairness of financial markets. It involves using non-public, confidential information to make trades that give an unfair advantage to the trader while leaving other investors at a disadvantage. This goes against the principle of equal access to information for all investors. When insider trading occurs, it erodes trust in the market and makes it difficult for businesses to raise capital fairly. Ideally, investors should make decisions based on publicly available information, allowing everyone to compete on a level playing field. By making insider trading illegal, governments aim to protect the interests of all investors and maintain a fair and transparent financial market.

"To ""threaten"" to arrest means to warn someone that if they don't comply or stop their harmful or illegal behavior, they will be arrested. It's called a ""threat"" because it puts pressure on the person to change their actions or face the consequences. Law enforcement officers use this approach to give the person a chance to avoid arrest, possibly resolving the situation without resorting to further legal action."	It's a threat because in certain states a citizen is allowed to arrest another citizen instead of only cops. . So you could threaten to arrest someone for breaking a law in an attempt to get them to stop. . If they don't, there's certain times you'd be ok to go pin them down and wait for cops with cuffs. .

Bail is money a defendant (not to be confused with a convicted criminal) puts down to ensure they show up for trial. If they show up for trial, they get the money back. If they skip town, they don't. Why is it not a big deal? Because simply being accused of a crime doesn't mean you are guilty, and if you simply lock someone up until they've gone through a trial this means that even for fairly small crimes like petty theft, someone might be locked up for many months even if they are later found to be innocent. This essentially would mean anyone accused of a crime would be punished as if they were guilty.	"Bail is a temporary release of a person accused of a crime, usually involving a payment of money to guarantee their appearance in court at a later date. The main purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused will show up to their trial while not having to remain in custody. Giving bail to someone is not a big deal because it's a way to uphold the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty. "" the court considers factors like the severity of the crime, flight risk, and the person's criminal history in deciding if bail is appropriate. In many cases, conditions are imposed on the person, such as travel restrictions, and if they violate these conditions or fail to appear in court, they face additional penalties."

White-collar criminals often get off scott-free for petty crimes or get vastly reduced sentences for larger acts with much proof stacked against them whereas us normal folk would face life or at least some jail time. Tldr; obviously a good lawyer costs more and requires years/decades of study and practice, but what is it that they do in/out of the court room to save people from their charges?	A good lawyer may minimize fines or sentences by questioning the accuracy of evidence, finding procedural errors or negotiating with the prosecution. For example, they might argue that a radar gun was not calibrated properly, or that the officer made a mistake during the traffic stop. Additionally, they can present their client's good character and circumstances to gain leniency. In white-collar cases, they may use similar tactics or negotiate plea deals to secure reduced sentences in exchange for cooperation with the investigation.	Depends. Usually some kind of technicality. Can the officer guarantee he was using the radar gun correctly? Is the procedure for using the radar comprehensive? Were the angles the gun was being used at within the manufacturers guidelines? Was the radar gun within calibration? Where was it calibrated and to what standard? What were the weather conditions that day and could they have caused reliability issues with the readings? A bloody great big huge host of things can be argued to cause inaccuracy with the readings.

For example if you use a gun to kill someone how could the bullet possibly be linked to you thousands of guns use the same caliber or a knife even though you would feel terrible looking at the knife wouldn’t it make more sense to just clean it and continue to keep the knife in your home so it make sense that your dna is on it? In movies, people always feel the need to get rid of the weapons but I think it would make more sense to keep it unless there’s something I’m missing.	Depends. It's not about keeping from being found at all. It's about preventing someone from proving that you were the one if they find you otherwise. For example say a security camera sees you and a couple other guys near the murder site at the appropriate time. That's enough suspicion to get a warrant to search your place, but not enough to prove you did it, but if they happen to find a knife you kept with traces of blood in the wood grain of the handle, or a gun whose rifling pattern matches the bullets (which is a forensics technique that can link a specific bullet to a specific gun) then you are in trouble. You can clean the knife sure, but maybe you didn't clean it well enough. And maybe you can scrape the barrel of the gun to fouled up forensics, but then the fact that you scraped out the barrel is unusual and counts as evidence itself.	When a weapon is used in a crime, it can provide incriminating evidence that connects the perpetrator to the crime. Each gun leaves unique markings on bullets fired from it, similar to a fingerprint. This is due to the internal components in the gun, like the barrel and firing pin, experiencing wear and tear over time. Forensic investigators can examine these markings and potentially match them to a specific gun, which would link the gun to the crime. Similarly, knives can carry traces of the victim’s blood, tissue, or dna even after being cleaned, allowing investigators to connect the weapon to the crime. Additionally, dna or fingerprints from the perpetrator might be left on the weapon, providing further evidence against them. In movies, disposing of the weapon is often shown as a way to eliminate this evidence, making it harder for law enforcement to piece together the puzzle and identify the criminal. By removing the weapon, the perpetrator is attempting to minimize the risk of it being used as evidence against them in an investigation.

To prove a claimant has no legal bearing to an estate, documentation such as an official birth certificate, death certificate, or adoption records can be used. Additionally, a will or trust, and court decrees can help establish the lack of a legal connection.	Whatever convinces the legal authority presiding over the matter.

A lot of former Nazis hid their identities and escaped to countries where they were not easy to identify, such as Argentina. However, the main reason for the recent prosecutions is that Germany changed what had to be proven to convict someone. Between 1949 and 1985, there were 200,000 investigations and 120,000 indictments of former Nazis in Germany, but less than 7,000 convictions. Those convictions required that a prosecutor prove a person's role in a specific murder. The German government changed its policy on Nazi war criminals around the year 2000, allowing prosecutions of Nazis who served in death camps or mobile killing units, based on their service alone, and not their role in any specific murder. As a result, former Nazis would couldn't be convicted before can be convicted now. So a number of people who were investigated and cleared are now being prosecuted because of this lower burden of proof. As far as identifying former Nazis who escaped, that happens at an increasingly less frequent rate because the majority have died at this point.	The reason it has taken so long to prosecute former Nazis is due to several factors, including the challenge of gathering evidence, the complexity of the legal process, and the passing of time. Firstly, gathering evidence against individuals involved in Nazi crimes can be difficult. Many documents and records were destroyed during or after world war ii, which makes it challenging to piece together the extent of their involvement. Additionally, witnesses who can testify about the actions of these individuals have become increasingly scarce over the years. Secondly, the legal process can be complex and time-consuming. Prosecuting former Nazis often requires international cooperation, as these cases frequently involve multiple countries. This can lead to lengthy legal battles, as each country has its own laws and procedures for handling such cases. Furthermore, some of the perpetrators have intentionally hidden their identity or location over the years to evade justice, which can also further delay the prosecution process. Finally, the passing of time has meant that many former Nazis have aged or passed away, making it harder to identify and locate them. The remaining living individuals who participated in Nazi crimes are now very old, which is one reason why we still see cases popping up today. Despite these challenges, efforts continue to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice, as it's an important part of acknowledging and remembering the tragedies of the holocaust.

Jury trials typically involve serious criminal cases or civil disputes, where a group of citizens assess evidence and decide the verdict. In minor cases or legal disputes, a judge alone makes the ruling based on law expertise.	Depends where the case is being tried or what the punishment is. Eg in england and wales if the crime you are accused of carries more than a 6 month prison term you can request a trial by jury, if it's under then it's trial by judge.
394	99f61bc9-a560-463d-b255-b0d1d38cf330.txt	Why can people bail out of jail?	"Bail allows people accused of a crime to be released from jail until their trial. The main idea behind bail is to ensure that the person will return to court, while avoiding unnecessary detention before being proven guilty or innocent. When someone is arrested, a judge sets an amount of money as bail, which must be paid for the person to be released. This acts as a form of collateral, as the money will be returned if the person attends all required court appearances. If they fail to appear, the money is forfeited, and they may face additional charges. Bail is a way to balance the legal principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" with the need to protect society and ensure the accused person faces justice. It allows those who can afford it to maintain their freedom and prepare their defense while awaiting trial."	In the US (and some other nations), the legal system is set up with the presumption that an a person accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty. Thus, it would be wrong to force people to possibly be imprisoned--maybe for years, waiting for trial--if they are actually innocent. However, if accused people are simply arrested and released, many do not return to court to face the criminal accusations (whether they are innocent or guilty). So, a bail system was developed, so that a person had to provide some kind of security that he would return to court. If the person on bail does not return, the court claims the money, which can then be used to help track down the person and bring them before the court.

If the deceased lawyer was part of a firm, their colleagues may take over the cases. For solo practitioners, local bar associations may step in to help assign the cases to other lawyers. Clients also have the option to find and hire new legal representation to handle their ongoing needs.	If the lawyer is part of a law practice, the practice will hold on to the papers and handle notifying the clients, etc. If the lawyer has their own practice, the practice might be sold and the new owner will notify the clients. Sometimes it is left to the executor or administrator of the lawyer's estate to notify clients and return their documents to them.
396	b51c0587-1ceb-41a9-9feb-7f2018fbb3a7.txt	How do prenups work and why do they get overturned by a judge sometimes?	A prenuptial agreement, or prenup, is a legal document created before marriage that outlines how a couple will divide their assets and financial responsibilities in case of divorce. Essentially, prenups can help protect each person's individual assets and reduce conflicts during a divorce process. Prenups can cover various aspects, such as property ownership, spousal support, and inheritance rights. For example, if one person owns a house before marriage, they may include a clause in the prenup stating that the house will remain their separate property in the event of a divorce. However, sometimes prenups can be overturned or set aside by a judge. There are several reasons for this:1. Improper execution: if the prenup wasn't signed voluntarily or if one party didn't have access to legal representation, a judge might find the agreement invalid. 2. Incomplete or false information: if one party didn't disclose their full financial situation, such as hidden assets, the prenup can be considered fraudulent and thus unenforceable. 3. Unconscionability: if the terms of the prenup are extremely unfair to one party, a judge might decide it's unconscionable and refuse to enforce it. Unconscionability can also apply if circumstances have drastically changed since the agreement's creation, causing severe hardship to one party. 4. Child support: a judge can't enforce provisions in a prenup that try to limit child support, as it's the child's right	They are legal contracts and can be overturned for various reasons including:illegal terms. No contract can override the law. Including the terms of child support or custody. This is determined by the court, no a prenup. If the include anything other than financial matters. They can't include who does the chores, etc. If any party lied or withheld information when creating the prenup. You can't hide assets or debt. You can't pressure the other person to sign the prenup. Presenting the prenup within a few days of the wedding would invalidate it. The point of a prenup is to specify what is personal property and what is marital property. The idea is if you inherit family heirlooms, you want them to go to your kids, not to your ex. If you specify that something is personal property, but then during the relationship you treat it as marital property, that can invalidate the prenup. Example, if your family has a summer cabin, and you want it to stay in the family, you could put that in the prenup. But then if during the marriage, you both spend money to renovate the cabin, pay the property taxes etc, it no longer belongs to just the one person.

Codifying refers to the process of organizing and writing down a set of rules or laws into a formal system or code, like creating a handbook or guideline. Legalizing, on the other hand, means making something that was previously illegal into a legal and permissible activity by changing the laws. For example, codifying a company's policies would involve writing them down in a clear and organized manner, while legalizing marijuana would involve changing the laws to allow its use and sale.	"Legalizing specifically means make something legal. Codifying means making something an actual law. A referee deciding a dog can play basketball because there ""ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball"" would be legalizing it, but not codifying it. Adding a rule that says a dog *can* play basketball would be legalizing it and codifying it. Adding a rule that says a dog *can't* play basketball would be illegalizing it and codifying it."

Second-degree murder is an intentional killing that is not premeditated or planned, such as a heat-of-the-moment crime. For example, if a person gets into an argument and impulsively kills the other person, it would be considered second-degree murder.	The difference is less about intent to kill and more about premeditation. In a second degree murder it was a sudden boiling over of emotion that caused the killing as opposed to the calculated nature of a first degree murder.

They measure physical changes, like heart rate and sweat, which can be triggered by various factors. So, results can be affected by nervousness or stress, leading to false positives or negatives.	Because they are not reliable. A guilty person who believes they are being honest will not trigger anything, while an innocent person who is nervous will send up a lot of red flags.

What's the difference between my state and a neighboring state where it has not been decriminalized?	The main difference between decriminalization and legalization is the way the law treats the use and possession of a substance like cannabis. In a state where cannabis is decriminalized, it means that possessing or using it for personal, recreational use is no longer considered a criminal offense. Instead, it's treated more like a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. The penalties may include fines or mandatory drug education programs, but usually no jail time. In contrast, legalization means that the government permits the use, sale, and distribution of cannabis, and it is regulated much like alcohol or tobacco. In a neighboring state where it has not been decriminalized, people caught possessing or using cannabis can still face criminal charges, which might include fines, jail time, and a criminal record.	"From:https://adf.org.au/talking-about-drugs/law/decriminalisation/overview-decriminalisation-legalisation/tldr: basically legalise is make legal, decriminalize is removing criminal penalties but still illegal! ""decriminalisation may replace criminal penalties with civil penalties. These could include referral to an education or treatment program, or a fine. Civil cases do not have to go through the court system and may be dealt with by tribunals. While records may be kept by a tribunal, these are not criminal records and will not affect employment, housing, or travel opportunities. The key difference to a criminal model is that in a decriminalised model, while penalties still apply for use and possession of drugs, they are no longer criminal charges. Decriminalisation is not legalisation. If drug possession and personal use are decriminalised, it is still illegal to possess and use drugs. Selling and manufacturing drugs still carry criminal penalties. """

I’ve read that they can protect the integrity of a case and protect the defendant’s rights to a fair trial. I think it makes sense that a judge wouldn’t want potential jury members to know things before a trial, but is that the only reason? (not saying that’s not an important reason. ) and is it an issue that potential jury members might see information on media sights from sources not involved in the case? I’m assuming a gag order couldn’t prevent that. Thank you for any info!	A gag order protects a case by preventing unauthorized information release, which could skew public opinion and influence potential jurors. This ensures a fair trial for the defendant. While media may share unrelated details, a gag order reduces the risk of juror bias.	You remember a few months ago when the depp and heard trial was dominating headlines for like 2 weeks straight? You issue a gag order to prevent that type of media fiasco from happening essentially, as that can be unfair for the people involved.

Axolotls have unique cells called blastema cells that can transform into different cell types, allowing them to regenerate lost body parts. Most vertebrates lack these cells or have limited regenerative abilities. Axolotls also have a high concentration of macrophages, immune cells that prevent scarring and promote regeneration.	This is something that scientists are actively studying now. Axolotl have a lot more genes than humans so it’s taking some time to figure out where their regenerative power comes from. In general though, humans and other lifeforms can’t regenerate as much because in our bodies, rapid cell division is cancer.

While prison food generally doesn't taste great, it does have calories and protein. That can also be supplemented with the stuff they can buy on commissary (fish packs, chicken packs, cheese, etc). You don't need protein powder, it's just an easy way to get more nutrients. Inmates also have the most important thing to getting big that most free people claim not to have: free time. I like to lift weights and do so a 3-4 times a week. But I also have other hobbies and responsibilities. Sometimes I skip a day. Sometimes im not feeling it and don't hit it that hard. Inmates don't have other real hobbies and beyond following the rules, no real responsibilities. So a lot spend their time exercising. Gym and yard couple times a week. Push-ups on the deck during dayroom. Sit-ups in the cell. When you have nothing else to do but exercise it becomes easy to make yourself do it all the time.	"The main reason people in prison can get ""jacked"" or muscular despite having limited nutrition and no supplements is due to consistent exercise and making the most of the resources available to them. In prison, inmates often have a lot of free time, which they can use to work out and develop a consistent exercise routine. They may not have access to a fully-equipped gym, but they can still perform bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, and squats, which are effective for building muscle. Additionally, they can get creative with their workouts, using items like water bottles or bags filled with books as makeshift weights. As for nutrition, while prison food may not be ideal, inmates can still make healthier choices within the options provided. They can prioritize protein-rich foods like beans, eggs, and canned tuna, which are essential for muscle growth. They can also trade or purchase additional food items from the prison commissary to supplement their diet. In summary, people in prison can get muscular by maintaining a consistent exercise routine, using their limited resources creatively, and making the best nutritional choices possible within their circumstances."

Cross-breeding species almost never produces a living offspring, and in the very rare circumstance that it does, the child is sterile.	You are using an old definition of species which had so many problems that it was discontinued decades ago. But it is still being taught because it is much simpler then the definition used by biologists today. So closely related species can produce non-sterile offspring, the more closely related the higher the chances. In addition to this the classification of the neanderthals as a seperate species is disputed, they might just have been a subspecies or variety of humans and not a seperate species.	Species classification is not always clear-cut, and there can be some overlap. Neanderthals and humans are closely related, sharing a common ancestor. This close relationship allowed for successful interbreeding and fertile offspring. Think of them as two branches on the same family tree. While they developed some distinct features, they were still genetically similar enough to produce viable, fertile offspring. This interbreeding is why modern humans have traces of neanderthal dna in their genetic makeup.

During sleep, your body produces less urine and it's more concentrated, meaning you need to use the bathroom less frequently. Additionally, the hormone vasopressin helps to reduce urine production at night. This combination of decreased urine production and increased hormone regulation allows you to sleep through the night without needing to go to the bathroom.	Your body produces a hormone called (vasopressin) antidiuretic hormone, or adh, which causes the body to produce less urine at night. It's the reason kids under a certain age can't have a dry night even if they're potty trained during the day. Their body just isn't producing enough hormone to get them through the full night.

Ok, so further explanation of my question. I know that in some point in the earth's far past, different molecules somehow became unicellular beings. I've heard theories of lightning striking mud etcetera, but either way, some physical event must have occurred. Can't that event be replicated inside a controlled environment in order to simulate unicellular life-creation?	There isn't a confirmed explanation for how life originated on earth, but the leading hypothesis is called abiogenesis, where simple organic molecules gradually evolved into complex structures. In laboratory experiments like the miller-urey experiment, scientists have replicated early earth conditions and observed the formation of amino acids, which are building blocks of life. However, we haven't yet fully recreated the exact process that led to unicellular life.	So not only can we recreate this in a lab, but we have (sorta). Scientists have simulated what conditions were likely like on the young earth, and demonstrated that rna can spontaneously form. So it’s not exactly demonstrating the formation of organisms, but it’s proof that nucleic acids could form which was likely an important step towards the first basic life forms.

407	1a794b71-fd90-4c03-adc2-2b4dd9c77fa4.txt	Why were animals so much bigger in prehistoric times? Dinosaurs seemed to have generally been so much larger than animals today. Huge dragonflies that dwarf their modern counterparts, turtles 10ft long. What is the mechanism that allowed them to be so large, or conversely makes modern ones smaller? Is it about oxygen levels, or efficiency, or something else?	Oxygen levels is apparently a myth with maybe the exception of insects. They breathe using spiracles, essentially holes in their body or limbs. It’s a much less effective way of breathing than having lungs and puts a limit on their maximum size. So more oxygen in the atmosphere does potentially increases that allowed limit. However for dinosaurs that isn’t the case. There were long periods of time when dinosaurs existed where oxygen levels were what they are today or even lower. From what I remember increasing in size was an evolutionary adaptation that worked for them and their bodies became increasingly specialised to “go large”. It was a wildly successful strategy and they dominated the ecosystem for hundreds of millions of years but it also made them especially vulnerable if the climate changed and they suddenly lost access to plentiful food and water. Such as when a large asteroid hits …	The main reason animals were larger in prehistoric times is due to higher oxygen levels and different environmental conditions. Oxygen levels during the time of dinosaurs were much higher than today, allowing for larger body sizes and more efficient respiration. This is especially true for insects like the giant dragonflies, as their size is directly related to the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Another factor is the abundance of resources and lack of competition. During prehistoric times, there were fewer species competing for the same resources, allowing some animals to grow larger. Additionally, the climate was generally warmer, which supported the growth of large reptiles like dinosaurs. Lastly, evolution played a role in the size of prehistoric animals. Over time, natural selection favored larger animals that were better at competing for resources and avoiding predators. As the environment changed and new species evolved, smaller animals became more successful, leading to the smaller sizes we see today.
408	2d108341-7c7b-49ea-afe5-cf08fb89b4d3.txt	Why does your body get achy when you are sick?	When you're sick, your body gets achy mainly due to your immune system's response to the infection. This response involves the release of chemicals called cytokines, which help your body fight off the illness but can also cause inflammation and discomfort. To break it down, let's imagine your body as a castle under attack by invading germs. Your immune system is like the castle's guards, working hard to protect you from the invaders. When the guards detect an enemy, they send out signals (cytokines) to call for reinforcements and coordinate their defense strategy. These cytokines are essential for a strong immune response, but they can also have some unintended side effects. One of the side effects of cytokines is that they can cause inflammation, which is your body's way of isolating and dealing with the infection. Inflammation can lead to swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area, as well as pain and discomfort. This is similar to how a castle's walls might become damaged during a battle, causing some discomfort for the people inside. Additionally, when you're sick, your body is working overtime to fight off the infection, which can leave you feeling tired and weak. This can cause your muscles to feel sore and achy, much like how you might feel after a long day of physical activity. In summary, your body gets achy when you're sick because your immune system's response to the infection involves the release of cytokines, which can cause inflammation and discomfort. This, combined with the extra work your body is doing to fight off the illness, can lead to aches and pains throughout your body.	"None of the top comments (at the moment of posting this) are correct. The achy feeling is caused three things:- general inflammation. The immune system uses inflammation basically as a way of communicating to itself and other body systems ""send resources here to help me fight the infection"". This inflammation itself causes pain, and sometimes it can spill over into areas of the body that aren't in need of special attention. There's a theory that this muscle and joint 'spill-over' inflammation pain is 'intentional' by evolution, because it causes us to be less active, which helps with recovery (rest), but this hasn't been proven. - toxic activities by the immune system. In some places, the immune system (white blood cells) are actually killing other cells that have become infected. The chemicals used to send these ""kill"" messages can also have a 'spill-over' into other areas of the body, causing pain. This is not a major part of sickness aches, though. - swollen lymph nodes. Your body is covered in hundreds of lymph nodes connected by a separate circulation network. When you are fighting an infection, one part of your immune system is trying to basically catch (eat) infected cells and pathogens and then bring them to lymph nodes where that can be broken down and/or shuttled away as waste. During this time, your lymph nodes swell with fluide and also experience some inflammation which helps get resources to them so they can work more effectively. Hope that helps."

From an evolutionary perspective, larger breasts may signal fertility and better ability to nurture offspring, attracting potential mates. Culturally, different societies and eras have placed varying emphasis on breasts as a symbol of desirability and eroticism. Media, fashion, and societal norms also play a role in shaping how breasts are perceived. Ultimately, the sexualization of breasts is a combination of biological instincts and learned behaviors, varying across different cultures and individual preferences.	Because they *are* sexual, or rather a sexual feature. Breasts produce milk for the offspring so ample breasts are a sign that a female can support children with food. There are various biological signs that can indicate an unsuitable mate; things like poor quality hair, a lack of fat around the hips, poor muscle tone, poor breast volume, etc. Which are indications of malnutrition or illness that can interfere with raising healthy offspring. Consequently all those things tend to be features instinctively considered when assessing how attractive a potential mate is to a male.

A fetus can not be deathly allegric to anything because it doesn't have a fully functioning immune system. The immune system is what causes allergies to exist. The body thinks its being attacked by a harmless material and tries fighting it off (sometimes to the demise of the human being). Without the immune system functioning fully, an allergy can't really exist.	When a pregnant woman eats a food her fetus is allergic to, the fetus is generally protected as the mother's body filters out allergens through the placenta. However, some allergens may pass through in small amounts. The fetus's immune system may react, causing mild symptoms or sensitization, but a severe reaction is unlikely. It becomes more critical to avoid allergens after birth, especially during breastfeeding.
411	5e054ede-a51b-476a-8254-3a9cb3367c44.txt	If muscle growth is caused by microtears, then what is the biological reason that a strain doesn't make your muscles grow even stronger?	Muscle growth, or hypertrophy, occurs when microtears in muscle fibers are repaired, resulting in an increase in muscle size and strength. These microtears are caused by working your muscles during activities like weightlifting, which puts stress on the muscle fibers and leads to small-scale damage. In contrast, a muscle strain is a larger-scale injury that occurs when a muscle is overstretched or torn. This can happen during an intense workout or while performing a sudden movement. Strains have more severe consequences than microtears, as they involve damage to both the muscle fibers and surrounding connective tissue. The reason a muscle strain doesn't lead to increased muscle growth like microtears do is due to the extent of the injury. While repairing microtears provides a stimulus for the body to strengthen muscles, repairing a muscle strain is more focused on healing the extensive damage. The body needs time and resources to recover from a strain, and the process of repairing the injured tissue doesn't promote the same growth and strengthening that occurs with normal muscle repair from microtears. Think of it like fixing tiny cracks in a wall versus fixing a huge hole. Fixing the small cracks makes the wall stronger, while fixing the large hole is more about restoring the wall to its original state rather than making it stronger.	Because the “muscle growth is caused by micro tears” thing is massively over simplified if not downright wrong. Your body can tell when a muscle is put under tension and allocate resources to build that muscle. Microtears might be a part of it, but the extent is unclear, and there definitely isn’t a 1:1 translation between muscle damage and muscle growth. Edit: since this seems to have ended up the top answer, let me know if you’re interested in a more in depth eli5 analogy for muscle growth and i’ll write one up. Edit 2: ok seems like people want more in depth. I want to put a disclaimer that if you want to know the actual science behind this stuff, I highly recommend finding people like [jeff nippard](https://Youtube.com/@jeffnippard), [mike israetel](https://Youtube.com/@renaissanceperiodization), etc. On Youtube. They provide super digestible and practical tips on muscle growth, and they back their claims up with analysis of actual studies. So if you want the science, go there, and i’ll provide an eli5 analogy if you just want something surface level. I’ll put it in a reply below since idk if i’m getting close to character limits.

"So fun fact, they did just discover a variety of seedless apples very recently. Not sure if they are marketable, but it's a ""thing"". The difference here is some fruit can do something called ""parthenocarpy"", it basically means the plant will produce flowers that *aren't* fertilized and will still grow into fruit. The resulting fruit, since it wasn't fertilized, will lack the reproductive seeds. It turns out some plants do this and those are our seedless fruits mostly. Some plants, like apple trees, *don't* do this, so we don't get seedless apples."	Seedless varieties exist in fruits primarily due to natural genetic mutations or selective breeding by humans. However, not all fruits can be easily bred for seedlessness. Apples and cherries are examples of fruits that are challenging to breed seedless varieties because they are produced by pollination involving both male and female parts. Creating seedless apples and cherries is more difficult than seedless fruits like grapes or watermelon because it would require significant genetic manipulation or advanced breeding techniques, which haven't been fully developed yet.

This is actually a very poor idea as it puts the food in the ideal conditions for spoilage for a longer time. The danger zone for food spoilage is 40-140f, so you want to hold food at those temperatures for as little time as possible. The thoughts about hot food overworking your fridge or warming other foods up to the danger zone may ha e had a grain of truth a long time ago, but nowadays it is a myth, as modern refrigerators are more than capable of sufficiently cooling whatever is put into it. The best practice is to take food and place it in shallow containers, then immediately place it in the fridge. This is what promotes the fastest cooling, and maintains your food in as safe a condition as possible. Edit: fun fact showing the importance of shallow containers. The very center of a soup/stew/chili in a large stock pot can take up to 24 hours to get completely cooled down	"Cooling food to room temperature before refrigeration helps to maintain the efficiency of the refrigerator and ensures proper food safety. When you place hot food directly into the refrigerator, the heat from the food raises the overall temperature inside the fridge. This forces the refrigerator to work harder and use more energy to maintain a cool temperature. This not only increases electricity consumption but can also shorten the lifespan of the appliance. In terms of food safety, bacteria grow the fastest between temperatures of 40°f (4. 4°c) and 140°f (60°c), known as the ""danger zone. "" if hot food is placed in the refrigerator, it takes longer to cool down, and the food spends more time in the danger zone, increasing the risk of bacterial growth. An appropriate strategy is to allow the hot food to cool at room temperature for a short period (about 30 minutes) before refrigerating it. This helps to minimize the temperature change inside the fridge and reduces the time the food spends in the danger zone, ensuring it remains safe to eat."

"Processed foods are products that have been altered from their natural state through various methods such as cooking, canning, freezing, dehydration, or adding preservatives. The primary purpose of processing is to extend the shelf life, enhance flavors, and improve the appearance of these foods. While not all processed foods are bad, many contain high amounts of added sugars, salts, and unhealthy fats. Eating too much of these can lead to various health issues. For example, an excessive intake of added sugars has been associated with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. High salt intake can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Unhealthy fats, such as trans fats, can raise your ""bad"" cholesterol levels and increase your risk of developing heart disease. Additionally, processed foods often lack essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber that our bodies need to function correctly. This is because processing often strips away these valuable nutrients, and even though some may be added back through ""enrichment,"" they might not be in the same beneficial form as found in whole, unprocessed foods. To sum up, processed foods are not inherently bad, but many contain high amounts of unhealthy ingredients that can increase the risk of various health issues when consumed excessively. It's essential to maintain a balanced diet, incorporating whole, unprocessed foods for optimal health."	"""processed"" foods is kind of a misnomer. The issue isn't so much the fact that the food was processed, but more about what kind of processing it went through and what was added to it. And to a large extent, how we're manipulating food for sale instead of nutrition. Take, as an example, a box of twinkies versus a can of corn. The can of corn is just as processed as the box of twinkies. It's cut, cooked, canned, and pasteurized. Sure, the nutritional content might not be *quite* as good as fresh, but it's pretty close and the processing does a lot to make sure the food is available when people need it, even if it has to go into long-term storage. But the twinkies... They're just as processed, but they're also filled with unhealthy levels of sugar, tweaked to promote appetite and maximize pleasure, almost entirely devoid of nutrition outside of raw calorie count, and all of that is done in the name of maximizing sales. So when you hear ""processed foods,"" what people are really talking about are the kinds of foods where the processing aims to maximize shelf life and marketability at the cost of nutrition."

The main difference between our nutritional needs and those of animals like goats lies in our digestive systems. Humans have a single-chambered stomach, which can only break down simple carbohydrates, protein, and fats. This means we need a varied diet to obtain all the essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and minerals. On the other hand, goats have a four-chambered stomach, allowing them to break down complex plant materials, like cellulose in grass, through fermentation. This process releases nutrients that goats can then absorb, providing them with their necessary nutrients, including carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. It's worth noting that even though goats primarily eat grass, they still benefit from a varied diet, including different types of plants, to ensure they get a balance of nutrients.	They evolved to eat only grass. That means a couple of things: they (usually) have more than one stomach and different gut bacteria which lets them extract all sorts of nutrients from the grass that we can't. These animals can also usually create some essencial amino acids (basically, very useful biochemistry supstances) that we can't and unlike them who can create those just from eating grass - we need to eat food that has contains those. Arguably, there should be some variation in animal's food too, like not eating just one species of grass but also some flowers and such, though this depends on the species. Pandas, for example, eat only bamboo iirc. Oh yeah, and koalas eat only or mostly just eucaliptus.

Studies have shown that there's no advantage to using warm water over cold when washing your hands. No temperature that's going to be safe for your hands actually makes a difference to the bacteria; the soap does the heavy lifting. For dishes, warm water is recommended because it's more effective at removing grease and loosening stuck food than cold water. But it's still not about killing bacteria; that's what the soap is for.	Warm water is recommended for washing dishes and hands because it helps to break down grease and dirt more effectively than cold water. Additionally, warm water combined with soap creates a better lather, which aids in removing bacteria and germs from surfaces. While cold water may slow down bacteria growth, it is not as effective in removing them from surfaces. Therefore, using warm water ensures a more thorough cleaning process.

Strain: overly stretched muscle, here the calf. Usually simple to heal. Can also be tendon which is more serious but also usually a rice injury. Rest, treat inflammation. Sprain: stretched or torn ligament. Come in grades ranging from 1 (rice) to 3 (complete tear, surgery). Fracture: the medical term for broken bone. Comes in a wide variety, always serious because it won't heal effectively if used.	A twisted ankle usually involves stretched or torn ligaments, causing mild pain and swelling. A sprained ankle is more severe, with more damage to the ligaments, and often involves more pain, swelling, and difficulty walking. A fractured ankle means there's a crack or break in the bones, which can be painful and limit movement. A broken ankle refers to a complete break in the bone, causing severe pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight or move the joint.

The decision to remove a male's foreskin, a practice called circumcision, dates back thousands of years and has cultural, religious, and medical origins. Ancient egyptians practiced circumcision for religious and cleanliness purposes. In the jewish faith, circumcision represents the covenant between god and abraham; similarly, muslims practice circumcision as a sunnah of prophet ibrahim (abraham). As for medical reasons, the belief that circumcision could prevent certain health issues and diseases gained traction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This led to the widespread practice of circumcision in countries like the United states. While the necessity of foreskin removal remains a topic of debate, the origins of circumcision extend across different societies and beliefs throughout world history.	It's old enough that nobody wrote down the name of whoever did it. There's no sir cumcise who invented it. Circumcision is sometimes an actual medical procedure, sometimes the foreskin doesn't pull down properly or gets twisted or infected or whatever else, and there's an actual reason to cut it off. So it's reasonable to think that from doing that, it would be realised that you can manage just fine with a circumcised penis. Lots of religious practices began as a necessity, and making it religious was just an easier way to convince people to do it more. Wikipedia has a list of proposed theories about the origin of circumcision: it came from before recorded history, so there's no way to actually find out.

"A bubble in the bloodstream, also known as an air embolism, can cause the body to go haywire because it disrupts blood flow and prevents oxygen from reaching essential organs. Imagine your blood vessels as a highway system, with blood cells representing cars. Normally, these ""cars"" flow smoothly and deliver oxygen and nutrients to different parts of your body. When an air bubble enters this system, it's like a roadblock on the highway. The flow of traffic is disrupted, and the cars (i.e. , blood cells) can't get to their intended destination. This means oxygen and nutrients don't reach vital organs and tissues, which can lead to organ damage or failure. In more extreme cases, the air bubble can block blood flow within the heart, leading to cardiac arrest, as the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. To summarize, air bubbles in the bloodstream are dangerous because they disrupt blood flow and prevent oxygen from reaching essential organs, leading to potential severe health complications."	Paramedic here-i’ve had this convo with an interventional cardiologist after he purposely foamed up some blood and injected it into cath line…he said that he did that so that he could see the blood flow (bubbles show on the xray video)through the heart. He explained that the air bubbles will dissipate as they pass through the lungs and that it would need to be a fairly large volume of air to cause any problems. In order to cause any problems, there would need to be a large volume of air in a standard iv line, like more than 20 inches, injected into a vein…a few bubbles isn’t going to hurt in a vein. It would cause a problem in an arterial line, though. I don’t think art lines are going to be in place very often in a non-hospital setting
420	ceb44791-5e7e-43d2-9b70-afc1723e0a0a.txt	What is the actual cause of a bad trip when taking mushrooms?	"A bad trip on mushrooms, or ""magic mushrooms"" (which contain the psychoactive compound psilocybin), is caused by a combination of factors, including the individual's mindset, environment, and the drug's effects on brain chemistry. To understand this, let's break it down into parts:1. Mindset: a person's mental state and expectations play a significant role in their experience with mushrooms. If someone is anxious, stressed, or has negative thoughts, these feelings can be amplified during the trip, leading to a bad experience. 2. Environment: the setting in which the mushrooms are consumed also plays a crucial role. A comfortable, safe, and familiar environment can help create a positive experience, while an uncomfortable or unfamiliar setting can contribute to a bad trip. 3. Brain chemistry: psilocybin affects the brain by binding to serotonin receptors, which are involved in regulating mood, perception, and cognition. This can cause changes in perception, emotions, and thought patterns. In some cases, these changes can be overwhelming or distressing, leading to a bad trip. A bad trip can be thought of as a ""perfect storm"" of these factors coming together. For example, if someone takes mushrooms while feeling anxious in an unfamiliar environment, the drug's effects on their brain chemistry may amplify their anxiety and lead to a negative experience. To minimize the risk of a bad trip, it's important to be in a positive mindset, choose a comfortable and familiar setting, and start with a low dose of mushrooms. Additionally, having a trusted friend or ""trip sitter"" present"	"There's no simple answer because ""bad trip"" refers to a category, not a specific phenomenon. Some bad trips are a result of circular thought patterns. You'll hear people say things like *""i got stuck in a loop""*. Other bad trips are a result of fighting against intrusive thoughts. Usually, they're memories of or residuals from unresolved trauma that the person refuses to confront and integrate. Still other bad trips are caused by fear and anxiety. Maybe the person's not in a safe, comfortable environment and they enter a sort of ""fight or flight"" mode in which they begin to hallucinate manifestations of their fears. This is why people advocate the principle of [set & setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/set_and_setting) as a tool for avoiding bad trips. Generally speaking, a bad trip is an experience primarily characterized by unpleasant emotions. Interestingly, even though there's not a single cause, there is a single solution: let go of fear and accept the experience. It's mental, it's temporary, and it's part of you but *it's not you*. You are not your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. They are an object of your consciousness, they are a reflection of your mind, and they are trying to show you something about yourself. Sit, breathe, listen, observe, and let it flow over and past you."

Antivirals are less commonly used to treat viral infections compared to antibiotics for bacteria and antifungals for fungi mainly due to the differences in the structure and life cycle of viruses compared to bacteria and fungi. Viruses are much smaller and simpler than bacteria and fungi. They consist of genetic material (dna or rna) surrounded by a protein coat, and they cannot reproduce on their own. Instead, they infect host cells and hijack the cell's machinery to replicate themselves. This close relationship between viruses and host cells makes it difficult to develop antiviral drugs that can target the virus without harming the host cell. On the other hand, bacteria and fungi are more complex organisms with their own cellular machinery for reproduction and metabolism. This makes it easier to develop antibiotics and antifungals that can specifically target the processes unique to bacteria and fungi, without affecting human cells. Another challenge in developing antiviral drugs is the high mutation rate of viruses. They can quickly evolve and develop resistance to antiviral drugs, making it difficult to create long-lasting treatments. In contrast, bacteria and fungi evolve at a slower rate, allowing antibiotics and antifungals to remain effective for longer periods. In summary, antivirals are less commonly used to treat viral infections because viruses have a simpler structure and a closer relationship with host cells, making it harder to develop drugs that can effectively target them without harming the host. Additionally, the high mutation rate of viruses makes it	Antivirals just aren't as good as antibiotics. There are a lot of antibiotics that are very good at killing bacteria, and will kill lots of different kinds of bacteria. So if you have a bacterial infection, even if you don't know exactly what kind of bacteria you have, you can often take an antibiotic that will do a great job of killing whatever it is that you have. You can take it for maybe just a few days and be basically cured. In contrast, antivirals are pretty lousy. None of the antivirals we have are effective against more than a narrow family of viruses. And most of them are pretty wimpy even there, requiring either multi-drug cocktails, treatment durations measured in weeks, and/or are able to only suppress the virus and not really cure you of it. Also, a lot of the antivirals that we have are fairly toxic, and tend to cause a lot of side effects. If antivirals were better, we'd probably use them more. Antibiotics are amazing, and so we use them a lot. We probably overuse them, but even if this weren't the case, there'd still be lots of opportunities for appropriate use.
422	d41586a1-a16a-4eb1-b413-b909fb97d209.txt	Can someone explain what is in catnip that causes their reaction to its effects?	Catnip contains a chemical compound called nepetalactone that triggers a reaction in cats. When a cat sniffs catnip, the nepetalactone molecules bind to receptors in the cat's nose, stimulating the sensory neurons. This leads to a response in the cat's brain, similar to how a cat reacts to pheromones. The brain processes this signal and causes catnip's well-known effects, such as rolling around, purring, and playfulness. However, not all cats are affected by catnip—only about 50-70% of cats inherit the sensitivity to it.	"Catnip has a terpene in it called ""nepetalactone"". The plant produces this chemical to repel insects, but it has a very different effect on cats. When nepetalactone is inhaled it stimulates the parts of a cat's brain that make them happy and excited. When it is eaten, it can activate the parts of the brain that make cats feel satisfied. So, when the cats smell the catnip, they might get very playful or feisty. If they eat some too they may eventually become very calm and mellow."

The spanish flu, which occurred in 1918-1919, and the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, both required people to take measures to protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus. However, the methods used in the 20th century were less advanced and relied more on basic public health strategies. In the 20th century, people survived the spanish flu by practicing good hygiene, such as washing their hands and covering their mouths when coughing or sneezing. They also used quarantine and isolation to separate the sick from the healthy. Public gatherings were limited, and some places even closed schools, theaters, and churches to minimize contact between people. Wearing masks was also encouraged, although they were not as effective as the masks used today. In 2020, people had more advanced tools and knowledge to combat covid-19. In addition to the basic hygiene practices and social distancing measures used during the spanish flu, people had access to better personal protective equipment, such as high-quality masks and face shields. Technology also played a significant role, with contact tracing apps and widespread testing helping to identify and isolate cases more efficiently. Furthermore, the rapid development of vaccines provided an additional layer of protection against the virus. In summary, people in the 20th century survived the spanish flu using basic public health strategies, while in 2020, advanced technology and medical knowledge	The 1918 pandemic was extremely badly handled. About half the worlds population got infected. Even though the world population was about a tenth of what it is today the death toll from the 1918 pandemic is as high or higher then the rescent pandemic. So in general people did not survive the 1918 pandemic. There were some efforts though which were somewhat successfull. Initially the sick were isolated. The US military ended up quarantening a lot of camps where disease had broken out. Information campaigns were started telling people to wash their hands frequently and wear face masks. But these efforts were not enough to stop the disease spread to the war in Europe. Here a lot more training camps were infected but they could not be quarantined due to the ongoing war. So the pandemic spread to the rest of the world. The advice to the population was pretty famelear to us now. Wash your hands, wear face masks, social distancing, self quarantining, etc. Studies have showed that these efforts at least slowed the spread of the disease but were not able to stop it.

Our brain consolidates memories and processes information from the day. Think of sleep as hitting the ""reset"" button for your body and mind, like when you restart your computer to fix an issue or improve its performance.

Nosebleeds occur when the blood vessels in the nose break, often due to dry air, nose-picking, or trauma. Our nose has many tiny blood vessels close to the surface, making them prone to damage. Other animals can also experience nosebleeds for similar reasons, like injuries or irritation. However, it might be less noticeable in animals due to their fur or because they don't express discomfort the same way humans do.	There are a lot of blood vessels in your nose, so too much strain due to things like picking your nose, sniffling, or blowing your nose can cause the blood vessels to rupture and bleed. Some people have more blood vessels closer to the surface, so, like me, you can be prone to nose bleeds. I don't know if other animals have this issue, but our noses are somewhat unique compared to other animals.

If they had to sleep in caves surrounded by a million different noises, predators, insects, and sleeping on primitive beds - I just cant see them getting any good night rests."	There's multiple factors of sleep hygiene they had, but many modern humans don't have:1. They didn't have desk jobs. They were much more physically active so they got tired more. 2. They spent a lot of time outside, so they experienced natural sunrise and sunset, which are signals to your body to start preparing for sleep (e.g. Releasing sleep-related hormones)3. They went to sleep whenever they felt like sleeping. They weren't forced to adjust their sleep time so they can wake up at a particular time to go to work. 4. Less mental stress overall. 5. No artificial light, apart from fire which is rather weak, and gives a warm orange color (similar to a sunset)6. They had much more time during the day to process their thoughts unlike modern humans who constantly busy themselves with work, tv, social media, etc. , making it impossible for your mind to process what needs to be processed, so that starts happen when you lie in bed and interferes with your sleep. Or maybe they often didn't even have good sleep. But if anyone reading this is struggling with their sleep, sort out the above mentioned points in your life and you're very likely to sleep better.	The main reason early hominids, like cavemen, were able to sleep in difficult conditions was due to their ability to adapt and their differing sleep patterns compared to modern humans. Let me explain this with an analogy and some examples. Imagine you're camping in the wilderness for the first time. The first night might be uncomfortable, with noises, bugs, and a hard surface to sleep on. But, as time passes, you'd get used to these conditions and even develop ways to make your sleep environment more comfortable. Similarly, early hominids adapted to their surroundings and learned how to minimize discomfort while sleeping. Also, early hominids likely had different sleep patterns than we have today. They didn't have artificial lighting, so they were exposed to more natural light-dark cycles, which regulated their internal clocks, making it easier for them to fall asleep when it got dark. Furthermore, they likely practiced segmented sleep, meaning they would sleep for a few hours, wake up for a while, and then sleep again. This type of sleep pattern can be more flexible and easier to adjust to different environmental conditions. Moreover, the survival instincts of early hominids helped them stay alert for potential threats. Their brain was able to process important sounds and wake them up quickly when needed, like a built-in security system. So, although their sleep conditions seem difficult to us, early hominids were well-adapted to their environments and had different sleep patterns that allowed them to rest effectively.

Is there some special response from your body when that happens that prevents any bad bacteria from poop getting into the wound?	The body has natural defense mechanisms to prevent infection in a cut, including on the anus. First, the blood clots to seal the wound, creating a protective barrier from bacteria. Second, the immune system detects foreign bacteria and sends white blood cells to fight them off. Although fecal matter contains bacteria, not all of it is harmful. Proper hygiene and keeping the wound clean also help in preventing infection. In most cases, the wound heals quickly, but if infection signs appear, it's important to seek medical attention.	Capillary and muscular action in that part of the body pushing everything out in one direction (not just waste from digested food but if you get a cut, the blood, too, etc. ), plus a robust immune system that handles most infections. It's not perfect, though. And infections do occur. Look up perianal abscesses when you get a chance, but not while eating.

I gave birth to twins in may. My ob explained that it’s not recommended to get pregnant again for at least 18 months(24 after twins) to let the body heal. Why does the body start doing the menstrual cycle again if it still needs time to heal? Is this just a flaw og our anatomy or what?	"The body allows pregnancy quickly after giving birth due to evolutionary pressures and hormone regulation, even though it is generally recommended to wait for 18-24 months before another pregnancy to ensure proper healing and recovery. In ancient times, high infant mortality rates meant that the ability to have children close together increased a woman's chances of successfully raising offspring. This led to a biological system whereby women would naturally start ovulating again shortly after giving birth, even if it wasn't always ideal for their health. But nowadays, with improved healthcare and lower infant mortality rates, it is safer and healthier to wait between pregnancies. After childbirth, the hormones regulating menstruation, mainly estrogen and progesterone, resume their normal patterns. In some cases, particularly when a mother is not breastfeeding, these hormones may be produced again more quickly, leading to menstruation and possible pregnancy. Conversely, breastfeeding can often suppress menstruation for several months or even longer, as it creates a hormonal balance containing high levels of prolactin, which inhibits fertility. This phenomenon is known as lactational amenorrhea. So, while it's not necessarily a ""flaw"" in our anatomy, our bodies have evolved to give us the potential to conceive quickly after giving birth. However, with modern knowledge and healthcare, it's advisable to wait the recommended time between pregnancies to ensure the best health outcome for both mother and baby."	Medical recommendations are made to be conservative, and are designed to maximize your health. Evolution, however, is not: evolution wants to maximize the number and success of your offspring, with your health only as an input to the second of those. The highest maternal mortality rate in the world, South sudan, has a rate of just over 1% per live birth. That's high enough to be relevant to you (it's about 2-3x your chance on average of dying to the early variants of covid, for example, and more than that because you're of childbearing age and therefore not very old), but low enough that you could have kids your whole life and *probably* not die. So evolution would by and large like you to have as many kids as resources will support - but your doctor wants you and your kids to avoid small-but-significant chances of death or disability in a way evolution mostly doesn't. An extreme example of this would a species like the octopus that just [straight up dies after producing offspring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semelparity_and_iteroparity). If you and your doctor were octopuses then your doctor would be quite right to advice you not to have children (in between his battles with spider-man, who has similar reproductive difficulties as a male of his own species), but evolution would lead your body in quite another direction.

It's a common misconception that tourette's only involves inappropriate words, known as coprolalia. In reality, only about 10% of people with tourette's experience coprolalia. Tics can be simple or complex, and can involve sounds, words, or phrases. The reason coprolalia stands out is because it's socially inappropriate, making it more memorable and noticeable than other tics.	"It normally isn't. That's the stereotype, but in reality it's often also things like ""ba"" or ""your shoe"" or other random words or noises. For some that will do the curse words one, there isnt freudian slips with tourettes; but it can sometimes be related to the emotion/feeling, so if someone is having anxiety and is more predisposed to doing the inappropriate ones, ""fuck"" will understandably fit with the feeling of anxiety"

Why do some potted plants benefit from being root bound and transplanting should be regularly done to gradually larger pots? When they grow in the ground there’s unrestricted space, so why do you want to avoid planting them in a larger pot to begin with?	Transplanting plants gradually to larger pots allows for better root development and water management. In a larger pot, the soil retains moisture longer, which can cause the roots to rot if they aren't extensive enough to absorb the water. Gradual pot size increases encourage the plant to develop a strong, dense root system that can effectively utilize the available space and resources. Some plants benefit from being root bound because it stimulates flowering or fruiting. In the ground, nature balances soil moisture and root growth, but in pots, gradual pot increases help mimic this balance.	Mostly root rot. You have a large volume of dirt, which is heavier and more compacted, which is now wet and has no roots in it to suck up the moisture. It stays wet, while the small part around the plant's roots starts to dry out, both from the roots and being closer to the surface. So you have to water it again. Now the rootless dirt is even wetter. Dirt that stays sopping wet for long periods of time tends to rot, and the resulting fungus will attack your plant's roots.

The visuals you're describing are called [phosphenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phosphene), and they're the result of you directly stimulating the cells in your eye. Normally, those cells are stimulated by light, and that's how your brain interprets that stimulation, but they can also be stimulated by pressure, radiation, magnetic fields, or even randomly fire on their own. In this case, the pressure on your eyeballs is triggering those cells to fire.	"When you press down on your eyeballs, you experience a phenomenon called ""phosphenes. "" phosphenes are visual sensations, like kaleidoscope-like colors, that are triggered by mechanical stimulation (pressure) rather than light. When you apply pressure to your eye, it activates the cells responsible for vision, called retinal cells, and they send signals to your brain. Your brain interprets these signals as visual information, creating the colorful patterns you see."

I was at a loss.	Dinosaur skeletons are more commonly found than those of our ancestors like lucy because dinosaurs lived for a much longer time, across a wider range of environments, and there were many different species of them. On the other hand, our ancestors were fewer in number, from just a few species, and mostly lived in limited geographical areas. Fossils form under specific conditions, which involve the quick burial of remains in sediment, like mud or sand, that eventually hardens into rock. These conditions were more common in the environments where dinosaurs lived, such as riverbanks and lakes, increasing their chances of becoming fossils. In contrast, our ancestors lived in areas where these ideal conditions for fossilization were relatively rare. Additionally, our ancestors had a smaller overall population than dinosaurs, making it less likely for their remains to be preserved. In summary, the reason we find more dinosaur fossils than those of our ancestors is due to the longer timespan, greater number, and variety of dinosaur species, as well as the increased likelihood of their remains encountering the right conditions for fossilization.	"Lucy (*australopithecus afarensis*) lived about 3 million years ago. The first things we'd look at and call ""our ancestors"" in that way aren't much older, maybe 6 million years at most. Until *homo erectus* these beings exclusively lived in east-to-South africa and were a pretty small part of the ecosystem there. Dinisaurs (excluding birds) existed for **200 million years** and for almost all of that time they were the dominant large life on the planet. So not only have we been around for, like, 1/40 the time as they were, but we're also a handful of species that lived in one small part of the world for most of that time. 'dinosaur' isn't one lineage like hominids - 'dinosaur' means *millions* of species over that time, in every possible niche - big, small, apex predator, little bug eater, jurassic equivalent of a cow, etc. There's loads of individual dinosaur species that have less fossil evidence than lucy's species - most are known from only one single fossil find."

"Dental student here, simplifying the answer as best as I can -it's because the living, soft part of the tooth (the pulp) is at the core of the tooth structure. It's surrounded by layers of hard ""dead"" tissues (dentin and enamel)it is literally surrounded by these hard tissues on more than 98% of its surface. When the pulp gets infected, it doesn't have breathing space per se. It's in its own small chamber and pressure builds up because there is no proper escape for the decaying tissue - hence it results in unbearable pain."	A toothache feels unbearable compared to other body aches because of the unique structure and sensitivity of teeth. Teeth are filled with nerves and blood vessels, making them highly sensitive to pain. This sensitivity can make a toothache feel more intense than other types of pain. Additionally, the nerves in the teeth are closely connected to the nerves in our face and head, so toothache pain can often feel more widespread and harder to pinpoint or ignore. Finally, since we use our teeth for talking and eating, a toothache can be frequently aggravated, maintaining the pain at a high level.

I grew up hearing that the main indicator of a species was that they only reproduced with one another. But neanderthals and humans cross bred. And they’re separate species. And in captivity lions and tigers can breed, but they’re obviously different species. Like I guess i’m just confused where the line gets drawn when deciding what is and isn’t a different species.	The distinction between species is based on the concept of reproductive isolation, which means that two different species cannot produce fertile offspring. However, this definition has exceptions, like neanderthals and humans. In such cases, factors like genetic differences, physical traits, and ecological roles come into play. The line between species can be blurry, and scientists often use multiple criteria to determine species status. Think of it like language dialects: they may be similar, but enough differences exist to categorize them separately.	The reality of it is that 'species' is a human-made concept that attempts to categorize/bin points that are continuous. It is easier to think about categories than complex continuous processes. The concept of a species is just something that makes it easier and more convenient to communicate groups of organisms. With this in mind, there has been quite a lot of debate as to what defines a species, and with every definition, there is usually an example of a species that breaks the rules of that definition.
438	e6287254-aedc-491a-bb8c-bde7c54a8453.txt	Why do we forget things or lose memories over time?	"Our brain is like a storage unit where memories are constantly being created, stored, and retrieved. However, over time, some memories fade or are lost due to multiple factors. One major factor is the weakening of connections between neurons in our brain, called ""synaptic connections. "" when we learn something new or form a memory, these connections are strengthened. But as time passes and we don't revisit those memories, the connections can weaken, making it harder to recall the memory. Another factor is interference, which occurs when new memories interfere with older ones. Our brain is constantly processing new information, and sometimes this new info can overwrite or mix up the details of older memories. Lastly, our brains undergo physical changes as we age, which can also contribute to memory loss. Neurons can deteriorate, and the hippocampus (a key area for memory formation) can shrink, both affecting our ability to store and retrieve memories effectively. So, memory loss over time is a result of a combination of weakened connections, interference from new memories, and age-related physical changes in our brain."	Former memory researcher, here. Hypothetically, once a memory is encoded into long-term memory, it is there forever. So when you can't remember something, it's not because it isn't there, but rather that you can't find your way back to that memory. Think about a memory like a cabin in a dense forest. If you visit that cabin often, there will be a well worn path to get there and its easy to find your way. But when you don't visit a memory often, the path becomes overgrown and harder to find. You may not be able to locate the cabin anymore. Now, even if we don't visit our cabin often, we can leave ourselves clues on how to get there. For instance, if you always have delicious smelling pies cooling on the windowsill of your cabin, you can use the smell and the path to get there. So even if the path is worn down, you're not totally lost.

Female nipples were banned primarily due to societal norms that developed over time, which placed importance on modesty and the sexualization of the female body. Historically, in many cultures, women's bodies have been considered private and were expected to be covered up to avoid unwanted attention or provocation. Female nipples have become sexualized, and their display is often seen as erotic or inappropriate in certain contexts. The lingering belief that people today find female nipples offensive mainly stems from these deep-rooted cultural norms and the continued sexualization of women's bodies. Some argue that this view is outdated and contributes to gender inequality, while others continue to support the idea of modesty and maintaining a distinction between public and private displays of one's body.	If you are talking about in the u. S. It was nudity in general. Not just female nipples. Men weren't allowed to go topless for a long time either. It was immoral and improper to be naked in public. And illegal. It wasn't until the 1930's-ish that a push happened to allow men to be topless in public places. It's now been allowed for long enough that its no longer really thought about. If a similar change happened for women it would probably become very similar after a few generations passed. Edit to add: what I mean by no longer really though about is that we don't really consider a man not wearing a shirt to be nudity any more.

Three possibilities:1 - they made it there during a flood and got stuck when the waters receded. 2 - many pond fish lay very sticky eggs specifically to stick to waterfowl like ducks and herons, that will then transport them to new bodies of water. 3 - humans stocked it for fun/sport fishing/ecosystem management.	Fish can end up in isolated lakes and ponds through various ways like being transported by birds, floods, and human interventions. Birds may accidentally carry fish eggs on their feet or in their digestive system, while floods can temporarily connect bodies of water, allowing fish to move. Humans stock ponds with fish for recreational or environmental purposes.

Animal life originated in the oceans because water provides a stable and supportive environment for life to evolve. In water, living organisms are protected from harmful uv radiation, temperature fluctuations, and dehydration. Additionally, water has buoyancy, which helps support body structures, and it's a medium for nutrients to be easily dissolved, allowing organisms to obtain essential resources. Life began in the oceans around 3. 5 billion years ago, and over time, organisms gradually diversified and evolved. Eventually, some species became adapted to terrestrial environments and migrated onto land, but the initial conditions offered by the oceans favored early life-form development.	So many reasons. 1. Water does not change temperature very quickly. Before life colonized the surface there would have been much stronger temperature shifts (somewhat like what we see in deserts today), making it much less hospitable to life. 2. Before oxygen (free oxygen is only produced by life) there would have been no ozone, meaning a lot more radiation. 3. Life as we know it is all about water. Inside the cells is water, and living in water means that you can take in and eject stuff easily. None of that water preservation or complex nutrient uptake systems.

In general, babies and children need lower doses of medication because their bodies are smaller and still developing. Their organs like the liver and kidneys, which help process drugs, aren't as efficient as adults', so lower doses are necessary to prevent potential side effects or toxicity. However, for adults, the difference in drug dosages isn't always determined by weight alone. Other factors such as metabolism, genetics, and body composition play a part too. Although weight can have an impact on drug dosages, the differences between adult weights often don't require a significant change in medication dose to achieve the intended therapeutic effect.	There should be, but it depends on the intended action of the drug. A 400lbs person might not have that much more kidney than a 125lbs adult, if you’re taking a diuretic drug for example. The dose does not have to be adjusted that much. A baby however also has different sized kidneys, which might still be developing. Some drugs such as weight loss drugs should ideally be adjusted according to body mass. The difference in age between adults seems to be a bigger problem, as seniors sometimes have decreased kidney or liver functioning and might need less or more of a drug.

Animals seem to fall asleep faster than humans because they have a stronger sleep drive due to their survival instincts. In the wild, they need to sleep efficiently to conserve energy and stay alert for predators. Humans, on the other hand, have more complex thought processes, which can keep the mind active and delay the onset of sleep.	I wouldn't say that's necessarily the case, but bear in mind that animals tend to sleep only when they feel tired whereas humans will attempt to sleep because they have work or school in the morning, for example. You must have experienced times when you feel really sleepy and you fall asleep within a couple of minutes.
444	1db60e2f-fa6e-484d-af6d-7186cb4270c4.txt	Why does it take so long to fall asleep initially, but feels super easy when woken up by your alarm?	Falling asleep initially takes time because your body needs to transition from an active, awake state to a relaxed, sleep-ready state. This process involves a decrease in body temperature, a release of sleep-inducing hormones like melatonin, and a slowdown of brain activity. Factors like stress, caffeine, and screen time can disrupt this process, making it harder to fall asleep. When you're woken up by an alarm, you might be in a lighter sleep stage, making it easier to drift back to sleep. This is because, during the night, your body goes through several sleep cycles, each consisting of light sleep, deep sleep, and rem sleep. Waking up during light sleep leaves you feeling groggy and wanting to go back to bed, while waking up during deep sleep or rem sleep can make you feel more refreshed and alert.	Sleep, like a lot of functions in your body, is controlled by hormones. To fall asleep your body needs to produce a certain amount of sleep hormones, as soon as that threshold is reached you fall asleep. When you get woken up by your alarm and haven’t gotten enough sleep yet your body is still full of sleep hormones, so falling back asleep is really easy. Then there are also sleep cycles, each cycle is around ~~3 hours~~ 90 minutes long. If you get woken up near the beginning or end of a cycle you’ll probably feel more or less fine, but if you get woken up in the middle you'll feel super groggy and want to finish up the cycle as fast as possible.

It seems like the mind is telling the person to do something but one cannot get themselves to actually do it.	"Adhd paralysis, also known as executive dysfunction, is a common symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). It occurs when a person struggles to initiate or complete tasks, even when they understand the importance of the task and have the intention to do it. This happens because adhd affects the brain's executive functions, which are responsible for organizing, planning, and prioritizing tasks. Imagine your brain as a busy office with a manager (executive functions) directing employees (thoughts and actions). In a person with adhd, the manager struggles to give clear instructions, causing the employees to become confused and unable to start or finish tasks efficiently. This results in the feeling of being ""stuck"" or paralyzed, despite knowing what needs to be done. It's important to note that adhd paralysis is not due to laziness or lack of motivation, but rather a neurological challenge that can be managed with appropriate strategies and support."	When everything you need to do feels like the same amount of effort as climbing a mountain, there are going to be a lot of days where there's not enough motivation in the tank to do those tasks. Pressure or fear (such as a looming deadline or giant consequences that are immediate and understandable) can force you up the mountain, but instead of the leisurely hike it should have been, it becomes a mad scramble. This causes a significant amount of unnecessary hardship and is very unpleasant. Basically, you let a bear chase you up the mountain because without it you'll sit at the bottom forever. Medication flattens the mountains into nice little hills, which means the motivation you have in the tank is now sufficient to get you up the hills without having to be chased by a bear.

It's sometimes called our ""sixth sense. "" for example, you can touch your nose with your eyes closed, thanks to proprioception. This sense relies on specialized receptors in our muscles, tendons, and joints, which send signals to the brain about the body's position and movements."	Knowing where your limbs and body parts are and what they are doing at all times without having to think about it. If you close your eyes, and then someone asks you to use your left hand and touch your right foot, you will be able to do it without looking. You can do that, because of proprioception.

Bmi (body mass index) uses kg/m^2 because it's a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height, not their volume. It's a simple, easy-to-calculate tool to estimate body fat and health risks. Using kg/m^3 or g/cm^3 would involve volume, which is more complex and harder to measure accurately for humans.	It's not really a unit of density, it's just a mathematical formula that we've found correlates decently with someone's health (specifically to be used as a rough marker for obesity). So yeah in theory if it was density then that would make sense, but the unit just follows the formula which is weight/height^2
448	e8dcc9fc-6134-4f92-8149-857e57c79a17.txt	What is the advantage for trees to have their leaves fall and regrow seasonally?	The main advantage of trees shedding their leaves seasonally is to conserve water and energy, especially during harsh winter conditions. During winter, the days are shorter, and there is less sunlight for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their food. Additionally, lower temperatures can cause the ground to freeze, making it difficult for trees to absorb water through their roots. Deciduous trees (those that shed their leaves seasonally) have developed this adaptation to cope with these conditions. By dropping their leaves, they drastically reduce water loss through a process called transpiration, which is the release of water vapor from the leaves' pores. Shedding leaves also prevents the build-up of snow on the branches, which could cause them to break. Before dropping their leaves, trees reabsorb important nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, and store this energy for the next growing season. This is why the leaves change color in autumn; as chlorophyll (the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis) breaks down, other pigments, like the red anthocyanins and yellow carotenes, become visible. When spring arrives, the days get longer, and temperatures rise, making it easier for trees to absorb water and perform photosynthesis. By regrowing their leaves during this time, they can maximize their energy production and continue growing. Essentially, this seasonal leaf shedding is an efficient method for trees to conserve resources and survive in varying climatic conditions.	"Two main reasons:first, leaves take resources to maintain. They represent a lot of surface for the tree to lose water, and water is often at a premium during the winter months. They're living tissue that requires resources and energy input. They offer a vulnerable starting point for plant diseases to get a foothold, so the plant needs to maintain its immune system within them. And so on. Since leaves aren't doing much in the winter anyway (it's too cold, too dry, and too dark for much effective photosynthesis), the tree drops them so it doesn't have to maintain them. (the cost of this is that it has to regrow them in the springtime, which also consumes resources. )and second, leaves offer surfaces for snow and ice to accumulate on. In areas with heavy snowfall, this can accumulate enough weight to break branches off the tree, which is a major injury. This is why you probably associate evergreens with conifers like pine and spruce, even though there are conifers that lose their ""leaves"" (needles) and non-conifers that don't. The needles of most conifers are an adaptation to heavy snowfall because they don't hold nearly as much snow on them, which makes keeping them in winter less risky for the tree."

"The appendix's usefulness was unknown for a long time because its function is not essential for our survival and its role is subtle compared to other organs. The appendix is a small, finger-like pouch attached to the large intestine. For many years, it was considered a vestigial organ, meaning it was a leftover from our evolutionary past with no current purpose. However, recent research suggests that the appendix may serve as a ""safe house"" for good bacteria in our gut. When our body faces an infection or illness that flushes out the gut, the appendix can help repopulate the gut with beneficial bacteria. This function is not critical for our survival, which is why it took so long to discover. Additionally, the appendix's small size and hidden location made it difficult to study and understand its role in our body."	Our modern medical understanding is only a century or two old. Your odds of surviving any injury worthy of medical treatment were the same 200 years ago as they were 20000 years ago, for the most part (there's many valid claims to be made about herbal remedies but we didn't have a solid grasp on antibiotics until 1928). The exact and precise function of any living tissue is hard to decipher because it is either a alive and part of a being that would prefer you didn't root around inside it or b dead, much more willing to be poked and prodded but no longer doing the processes it did while alive. So figuring out specifically what one auxillary organ does is just hard. And there's other bigger, more relevant organs to figure out first.

The number of generations cannot be less than 5 from mathematical point of view but can we put an upper limit?	Having 2% neanderthal genes doesn't necessarily mean that one of your ancestors was 50% neanderthal. Instead, it indicates that your ancestors interbred with neanderthals at various points in history. The neanderthal genes have been passed down and diluted over many generations. It's difficult to pinpoint an exact generation where an ancestor was 50% neanderthal, as gene inheritance is not always a perfect 50/50 split from each parent. Additionally, the number of generations since interbreeding with neanderthals is estimated to be around 2,000 to 3,000, making it challenging to determine an upper limit for the percentage of neanderthal ancestry in a specific generation.	Actually, it means at least one (and maybe quite a few) of your ancestors was completely neanderthal and had a child with a modern human, and of course all of their ancestors would be neanderthal. However that doesn't lead to a simple time line for when the populations mingled. If a population of 1000 sapiens absorbed a population of 20 neanderthals, after a while the proportion of neanderthal genes in everybody in that population might stabilize at 2% and might stay at that level for many generations. Or, the percentage could rise or fall depending on if those genes had positive or negative effect on survival and reproduction.

As a fruit ripens, it produces more sugar through a process called starch conversion. Initially, the fruit contains starch, which is a complex carbohydrate. During ripening, enzymes break down the starch into simpler sugar molecules, like glucose and fructose. This increase in sugar content is what makes the fruit taste sweeter over time. So, the sugars aren't already there, but they're created from the existing starch as the fruit ripens.	There are two factors, the first is universal: starch is converted to sugar during ripening, and while starch isn't sweet to us, sugar is. Specifically the starch is broken down into simple sugars such as sucrose and fructose. The second is specific to some fruits, and that's the reduction of sour or bitter compounds in the fruit, which further enhance palatability and the sense of sweetness.

I’ve been talking to a guy for a couple of months now, and to this day I get this butterfly sensation in my abdomen whenever I see his name pop up on my phone.	"When you talk to someone you like, your body releases adrenaline, a hormone that triggers the ""fight or flight"" response. This response is your body's natural reaction to a perceived threat or exciting situation. While the person you like isn't a threat, your body still reacts this way due to the anticipation, nerves, and excitement of interacting with them. The adrenaline causes your heart rate to increase and blood flow to divert to your muscles, making your stomach feel like it's fluttering – the ""butterflies"" sensation. This instinctive reaction has likely evolved to help us be more alert and prepared in situations that matter to us, including those that involve potential romantic partners."	"When we have a strong emotional response, it resembles our ""fight it flight"" response. A lot of hormones and other chemicals are released in the body, and one of them (epinephrine, aka adrenaline) makes the body shift blood from the stomach and intestines to other vital organs, muscles and the brain. This decrease in blood flow is what gives your stomach that feeling. It's also why you get a warm, flushed feeling as the blood vessels in the muscles and skin dilate (expand) to carry more blood. If you pay close attention, you may also notice lights seem brighter. This is because it also makes your pupils dilate to let in more light for better vision."

The black plague didn't completely vanish, but it significantly decreased due to a combination of factors. In summary, the decline of the black plague was primarily because of the natural life cycle of the disease, increased immunity in survivors, and better prevention methods. First, the bacterium responsible for the plague, yersinia pestis, has a natural life cycle, which means it eventually dies off. Second, many of those who survived the plague developed immunity, so the disease couldn't spread as easily. Finally, people learned better prevention methods, like quarantining infected individuals and improving hygiene. Over time, these factors led to the decline of the plague, and it became less of a widespread issue by 1353.	The main reason for the end of the black death was the implementation of successful quarantines that allowed pockets of infection to burn themselves out. But it didn't disappear overnight, numerous smaller local outbreaks continued for a long time after. Improvements in overall hygiene, sanitation, and dealing with the rats is what eventually got rid of the black death for good. Although it is still around today, just very uncommon. Modern anti-biotics and sanitation is what prevents it from being a problem. Another working theory is that the black death killed off so much of the European population that those that remained living were the ones that had a degree of immunity or were more naturally resistant.

"Smoking weed, cigarettes, and vaping are all different ways of consuming substances that have varying levels of impact on your health, and when people say that smoking weed is ""better"" compared to cigarettes or vaping, they usually mean that it's less harmful in certain aspects, but not necessarily harmless. First, let's address the substances involved. Cigarettes contain tobacco, which is filled with thousands of chemicals, including nicotine (an addictive substance) and other harmful substances like tar and carbon monoxide. These chemicals are known to cause various health issues, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Vaping, on the other hand, uses electronic devices that heat up liquid, known as e-liquids or vape juice, which mostly contain nicotine and various other chemicals, but typically not tar or carbon monoxide. Some of the chemicals in e-liquids are also present in cigarettes, but generally in lower amounts. Research suggests vaping is less harmful than cigarette smoking due to the reduced presence of harmful chemicals, but is still not without risks. Now, when it comes to smoking weed, the main psychoactive ingredient is thc (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is responsible for the onset of effects such as relaxation and euphoria. Unlike nicotine, thc is not considered physically addictive. While marijuana smoke does contain some harmful substances, such as tar and carbon monoxide, it has fewer chemicals compared to tobacco smoke. It's important to remember, however, that inhaling any smoke can harm your lungs since combustion generates harmful substances. In this sense, smoking weed is not completely harmless. Also, the long-term effects of vaping are still being studied, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential health risks. In summary, although people might consider smoking weed to be ""better"" than smoking cigarettes or vaping due to the differences in chemical components and levels of harm, one must not forget that any form of smoking or inhaling foreign substances can have negative effects on health. So, it's essential to keep in mind that ""better"" in this context doesn't necessarily mean"	Short answer : in absolute terms, smoking weed creates more tar and other nasty compounds than tobacco. However, you normally smoke a **lot** less weed than your do tobacco. Second, substances in smoked cannabis also trigger/enhance apoptosis. That’s the process that causes cells with mutations or other damage to stop reproducing and die. We *think* that there are better outcomes with pot, and fewer instances of problems because apoptosis triggers cause damaged cells to die rather than hanging around and reproducing, and accumulating more damage until they hit a malignant mutation. **edit**: apoptosis is not a good or bad thing. It’s a programmed form of cell death that does not only occur in damaged cells. It triggers it in healthy cells too. Like most things in medicine, whether it is good or bad is a matter of degree and circumstance. The endocannabinoids may be helpful in protecting against long term damage from cannabis use, and *also* damaging in other ways. Even the “bad” effects - like immune suppression ( it triggers cell death very efficiently in certain kinds of immune cells ) - can be beneficial in the right circumstances. They are being studied as a way to help prevent death from acute respiratory distress, and “cytokine storms” where the immune response runs of control in a dangerous, or even lethal fashion. **edit 2**: anything you set on fire is going to produce compounds that are bad for your lungs. Pot smoke is also bad for your lungs, as is the smoke from incense, candles, wood and anything else you burn. Pot [smoke] is “safer” than tobacco [smoke] in some ways, and worse in others. Reality is complicated, biology even more so.

Earthquake survivors can manage without water for extended periods due to the human body's ability to adapt in crisis situations. Even though we usually need water every couple of days, in extreme cases, our bodies can slow down their functions and tap into stored water found within our cells and muscles. Additionally, survivors may find pockets of trapped moisture or condensation in the rubble, which can provide minimal but life-saving hydration. The will to survive and sheer determination also play a significant role in enduring these challenging circumstances.	A big contributing factor here is the fact that these victims are remaining effectively motionless while waiting to be rescued. Every little thing your body does, every muscle contraction and even burning sugar consumes water. That's one of the reasons why doctors are always telling you to stay hydrated while you're healing from an injury. These people are tramped under rubble and effectively motionless for days at a time, which significantly reduces their daily need for water, allowing them to survive much longer than we are used to without drinking.

They seem to be interested in humans because we appear novel and do not pose an immediate threat. However, dolphins' behavior can vary greatly, and sometimes they display aggressive or bullying behavior towards other sea creatures. This occurs mainly due to competition for resources, establishing social hierarchy, or training younger dolphins. It's important to understand that while dolphins can appear friendly, they are wild animals with their own instincts and social behaviors, which can be both cooperative and competitive.	I used to know a dolphin trainer at a really unethical place, and he said that the dolphins would try to drown the divers occassionally, so they had to always have a buddy. Apparently the dolphins would hold them at the bottom of the tank until the oxygen bubbles stopped rising and one may have killed a diver at a previous place. Like I said, the dolphins were in really shitty conditions and I think they knew who to blame. I'd heard of orcas doing that but didn't know it extended to dolphins.

Adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and anxiety are closely linked because they share common features and can affect each other, making it difficult for an individual to function in daily life. Adhd is a neurological disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. These symptoms can make it challenging for a person to focus, manage time, and complete tasks, leading to difficulties in school, work, and social settings. Anxiety, on the other hand, is a feeling of worry or unease about a particular situation or event. It is a natural response to stress and can help us deal with challenging situations. However, in some cases, it can become excessive and interfere with daily life. The link between adhd and anxiety can be compared to a seesaw, with adhd symptoms disrupting daily functioning and making it difficult for the person to cope with stress, which in turn increases their anxiety levels. This increased anxiety then further exacerbates adhd symptoms, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Additionally, both disorders are related to dysfunction in the brain's neurotransmitter system, particularly the systems governing dopamine and norepinephrine, which play crucial roles in regulating mood and attention. This shared neurological basis further contributes to the connection between adhd and anxiety. In conclusion, adhd and anxiety are linked due to the overlapping symptoms, mutual impact on a person's daily life, and shared neurological basis, making it crucial for individuals with either disorder to seek appropriate treatment and support.	Other commenters have covered other aspects, so i’ll add this: one aspect of adhd which has not been studied a great deal but is commonly observed is “rejection sensitive dysphoria”. This is an extreme, emotional response that a lot of adhd people have when there is a real, or perceived negative judgment of them. I think rsd is when the adhd brain fixates on a negative thought and keeps bouncing it around in your head. You’re not good at focusing on other things to take it off of your mind, so it can be really hard to move on when you think you upset someone. This I think, in turn, plays into self-esteem and anxiety. Edit: to be super clear on this point, as u/cantevenusethisthing pointed out, rsd is not something that's been empirically confirmed. There seems to be some amount of controversy among experts as to whether it is appropriate to use the term. Emotional dysregulation may be a more complete explanation of what is colloquially referred to as rsd. I find that I have experienced what it describes, as have many others I've talked to, but be aware it's not an officially recognized condition/aspect of adhd by international healthcare organizations.

For example, let's say that an insect is flying toward the direction of the sun, how do they block off the brightness of the sunlight?	Insects have a unique visual system known as compound eyes, which are composed of thousands of small units called ommatidia. Each ommatidium has its own lens and processes light independently, allowing insects to detect light and movement from different directions. To deal with bright sunlight, many insects have built-in adaptations, such as pigments in their ommatidia that filter light or varying the amount of light received through different ommatidia. Additionally, some insects can change their behavior to avoid direct sunlight exposure by flying or resting in shaded areas. In summary, insects can handle bright sunlight using their specialized eyes and by adjusting their behavior.	The human eye uses a large lens which focuses light onto the retina. It's a very effective way to capture light, and our retinas are quite sensitive over a wide range of brightness. A downside is that very bright lights like the sun get focused onto the delicate retina so intensely, it causes damage. Insects, on the other hand, have compound eyes that don't use large lenses. These eyes have an excellent field of view and ability to detect motion, but aren't so sensitive to light. Overall, insect eyes don't focus light as intensely, and focus it onto less sensitive tissue.

Wont it benefit us if we exercised while we're sick?	The main reason we're advised not to exercise when sick is because our immune system is already working hard to fight off the infection, and adding the stress of exercise can take away resources that are needed for that battle. Exercising while sick may actually prolong the illness or make the symptoms worse. The lymphatic system is, indeed, important for our immune response and relies on muscle contractions to move lymph fluids. However, exercising when you're sick can have some potential downsides. Firstly, it's important to understand the role of the immune system during an illness. When we're sick, our immune system is working overtime to fend off the infection. Physical exercise is a form of stress on your body, and when you exercise, your body diverts resources like energy and nutrients away from the immune system and toward the muscles. This can potentially weaken the immune system's ability to fight the infection efficiently. Think of your immune system as a team of workers fixing a problem in your town. If these workers must suddenly also put energy into a race, they won't be able to fix the problem as quickly or efficiently as they could have otherwise. Another factor to consider is the risk of worsening your symptoms or spreading the illness to others. When you're sick, your body may experience fatigue, fever, or dehydration from the infection. These symptoms can be exacerbated by exercise, making the illness worse or prolonging the recovery process. Additionally, if you're exercising in a public space, you risk passing the infection to others. That being said, the type and severity of the illness can determine the appropriateness of exercise during this time. In cases of mild colds or illnesses where symptoms are above the neck, like a runny nose or sneezing, light exercise may actually help alleviate some of those symptoms. However, if you have symptoms like fever, body aches, or respiratory issues, it is generally best to avoid exercise and rest. In conclusion, we're told not to exercise when sick because our immune system needs all available resources to fight off the infection, and exercise can potentially weaken that response. Additionally, exercise may worsen symptoms or spread the illness. It's important to listen to your body and prioritize rest and recovery when you're not feeling well to help your immune system do its job.	"I am a doctor of physical therapy and work in a rehab with very sick people, so this question is right up my alley. I would say that I promote physical activity with patients who are sick, but not ""exercise"" in the way most people would think. It does depends on the type of sickness, but lets go with a respiratory cold/flu. Your body depends on movement for various body systems to run correctly, such as the blood vessels and lymphatic system you mentioned(kind of like blood vessels around the body, but carry clear fluid with immune cells in them) and will benefit from being circulated around the body to clear out waste from the site of infection and bring in new immune cells to continue fighting. My other concern with people being sedentary with a respiratory infection is the risk of fluid collecting in the lungs and causing a pneumonia. Movement will increase the rate and depth of breathing to open up the passages to the deeper parts of the lungs and allow for fresh air to get in and get behind the phlegm in order to cough it up. However, there is a limit to the amount of activity I recommend, and with the elderly population I work with, energy conservation is important to balance their mobility and rehab needs(getting up to walk to the bathroom, perform light seated exercises to maintain strength) without over fatiguing them and affecting their body's ability to mount an immune response. Usually my patients have a handful of other chronic diseases, so I am considering many other factors when prescribing exercise than if it was an otherwise healthy 30 year old with a cold. Younger individuals usually have much more energy reserves, so if an otherwise healthy adult over fatigued themselves while sick, they should be able to bounce back fairly easily."

I was raised in a family that believes it’s just straight up poison and does more harm than good. But i’ve realized that I don’t have a clue how chemotherapy works or even what it is, just that it’s really brutal on your body and mind.	There are different types of chemotherapy, but in broad eli5 terms they tend to work the same way, by targeting fast-dividing cells. Cancer, being uncontrolled cell growth of mutant cells, is generally gong to divide much faster than most of our cells. Some of these chemotherapy agents directly damage the dna, but concentrations required to do that are related to metabolic rate, so cancer cells will tend to get a lethal dose while most of you won't. Unfortunately we *do* have some fast dividing cells such as the lining of our gi system, our hair follicles, blood and immune stem cells, etc. That's why chemo often causes nausea, hair loss, reduced immune function, sores in the mouth and gi and other issues. So yes it is poison, but carefully engineered and targeted poison that attempts to spare as much healthy tissue as it can.	Chemotherapy is a treatment method that uses drugs to destroy or slow the growth of cancer cells. It works by targeting rapidly dividing cells, which is a common characteristic of cancer cells. However, this also affects healthy cells that divide quickly, such as those in hair follicles and the digestive system, leading to side effects. There are different kinds of chemotherapy drugs, each with a specific way of attacking cancer cells. Some may work by damaging the dna of cancer cells, while others may block certain processes that enable cell division. Often, a combination of drugs is used to enhance effectiveness and reduce the chances of cancer developing resistance to a single drug. While chemotherapy can have severe side effects and even be life-threatening in rare cases, it has proven to be a beneficial treatment for many patients. Its effectiveness depends on the type of cancer, the stage of the disease, and the specific drugs used. The potential benefits and risks should be discussed with a doctor to make an informed decision about chemotherapy as a treatment option.

I'm sure it would make everything more energy efficient.	Our eyes see images upside-down because of the way lenses in our eyes work. Lenses bend light to focus it onto our retinas, and while bending light, images get inverted. If eyes projected images right-side up, lenses would need a more complex design, potentially making our vision less sharp. Our brain flips the image easily, as the visual processing in our brain is incredibly efficient. So, the combination of a simpler lens design and the efficient brain processing actually saves energy and provides us with clear, right-side up vision.	That's just how lenses work. Your eyes would need to have a much more complex lens setup to project it the right way on your retina. It doesn't matter though, and there's no inefficiencies in doing this. Our brains don't know what the world looks like when we're born. They don't know if the image is upside down, sideways, mirrored or whatever else. It just notices that some movement in this area of the retina means something else is happening somewhere in the real world. Up or down makes no difference.

Down syndrome occurs in humans when there is an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. Animals can have similar genetic abnormalities, but they are not called down syndrome because that term specifically refers to humans. In animals, these conditions may have different effects or be less common due to differences in their genetic makeup and reproductive mechanisms. For example, many animals with genetic mutations may not survive to be born, while others may not show noticeable effects in their behavior or physical appearance.	Because down syndrome describes a very particular genetic disorder in humans. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells. Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. Animals don't have the same chromosomes as us, so they literally cannot have the same disorder. It's like asking why a snake can't get a broken leg. That's not to say animals can't have their own genetic disorders, they almost certainly do. But down syndrome is particularly referencing human chromosomes.

The main reason your tongue struggles to direct your fingers in removing something stuck in your teeth is due to differences in sensory perception and spatial awareness between these two body parts. First, let's discuss sensory perception. Your tongue is extremely sensitive and can detect even minute changes in texture, temperature, and pressure. This sensitivity helps you explore the texture and taste of food. However, this also means that the sensations felt by your tongue can be amplified, making it difficult to accurately judge the size and location of the food particle stuck in your teeth. On the other hand, your fingertips are designed to help you feel and manipulate objects in your environment. They have a highly developed sense of touch, allowing you to pick up and handle small items with precision. However, this precise touch is adapted to external objects and not necessarily to the sensations in your mouth. Now, let's talk about spatial awareness. When you reach for an object, your brain processes complex spatial information using cues like depth, distance, and relative positioning. This is called proprioception, which is your body's ability to understand its position and movement in space. When using your tongue to locate an object in your teeth, you're relying on an indirect form of spatial awareness. Your tongue may have a general idea of the location, based on sensations from your taste buds and surrounding tissues, but it's not as efficient as your fingers in processing precise spatial information. To illustrate this point, imagine trying to grab a pencil off a table while looking at the reflection of the pencil in a mirror. While you have a general idea of where the pencil is, accurately grabbing it may be challenging due to the unusual spatial relationship. In conclusion, the challenge of removing something stuck in your teeth with your fingers is rooted in the differences between the sensory perception and spatial awareness abilities of your tongue and fingertips.	Because the tongue operates on a different sensory scale and in a sensory sphere than your fingers. While your eyes, hands, fingers and every other part of your external body has to cooperate to some degree this means that these bodyparts have a shared sense of scale and a shared sense of knowing where everything else is, because you're no longer a baby. Babies might have problems figuring out where the hand is supposed to go, but not you. You're an adult and you've had years to figure that out so that the process is now automatic and near perfect\*. Although in some people (like for example people who play sports involving throwing/kicking balls etc) this coordination is even better. However. Your mouth doesn't interact that way with the rest of your body. To the tongue the mouth is a much larger space than it is to the fingers and you've never really had to work out exactly how to cooperate between tongue and fingers the same way your hand and eye cooperates. So you're still experiencing the same problem a baby experiences when it comes to coordination. If you practiced it for months you'd probably overcome that problem, but why should you? &#x200b;\*unless you're drunk (or otherwise impaired) or developing neurological issues. P. S: as an additional issue your tongue is the only boneless limb. This means that the tongue doesn't have any of the nerves measuring tendon tension that all of your other limbs have. As a result it's really hard for the body to know exactly where the tongue is positioned.

The main difference between espresso beans and regular coffee beans is the way they are roasted and used for brewing. Both espresso and regular coffee beans come from the same source, which are the seeds of the coffea plant. Espresso beans are usually roasted for a longer time and at a higher temperature than regular coffee beans, resulting in a darker, more oily appearance. This darker roast brings out a bolder, richer flavor that is essential for making a strong, concentrated espresso shot. On the other hand, regular coffee beans have a lighter roast, which gives them a milder flavor that works well for drip coffee, pour-overs, and other brewing methods. It's important to note that you can technically use any kind of coffee bean to make espresso or regular coffee; it's the brewing method and the roast level that dictates the end result, which is why we have separate terms for them.	It's less in the beans, but in the processing. Espresso beans do tend to be more heavily roasted - meaning less caffeine and more dark color and flavor, also some changes to the way the oils and things can be later extracted in the brewing. But mostly, espresso beans refers to the processing, they are ground much finer and brewed using a different mechanism (not just a regular drop coffee pot, more of a press) to produce smaller amounts of higher concentration coffee. Edit - for clarify - when I say less caffeine, I mean that roasting ruins the caffeine, light roasts have more caffeine, darker less. But espresso is *served* in more concentrated doses so an espresso drink usually has *more caffeine* per oz than drip, but a light roasted bean has more caffeine per oz. Than dark roasted beans. Does that make sense?

Is the conversion instant , gradual or do you have to wait for all dopamine to be converted to norepinephrine ?	The conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine in people with adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) taking medication occurs gradually, and they may benefit from the effects of both molecules simultaneously. To understand this process, let's first look at the role of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward, motivation, and reinforcement, while norepinephrine is another neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in attention and focus. In people with adhd, it is believed that the levels of these neurotransmitters are imbalanced, causing difficulties with attention, focus, and impulsivity. Adhd medications, such as stimulants like ritalin (methylphenidate) and adderall (amphetamine salts), work by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. They do this by blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, meaning that they remain in the synaptic gap between neurons for a longer period. This increases their availability and ultimately boosts their effects, helping to alleviate the symptoms of adhd. The conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine is a continuous process that occurs inside a specific type of neuron, called the noradrenergic neuron. This neuron has an enzyme called dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (dbh), which is responsible for transforming dopamine into norepinephrine. When taking adhd medications, both neurotransmitters are being increased in the brain, so the conversion process is gradual and happening constantly as long as there is dopamine available. Regarding whether adhd individuals benefit from both molecules synergistically or one at a time, the answer is both. Dopamine and norepinephrine play different roles and are involved in distinct neural pathways in the brain. While norepinephrine is crucial for attention, focus, and alertness, dopamine is essential for motivation, reward, and reinforcement. Together, they help adhd individuals improve their attention, impulse control, and motivation, allowing them to perform better in various aspects of their life. However, it's essential to note that the effects of these medications and neurotransmitters may vary from person to person. Factors such as genetics, individual brain chemistry, and other environmental factors can make the experience of each person with adhd unique. In conclusion, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine occurs gradually in the brain of adhd individuals taking medications. Both neurotransmitters work simultaneously to address the symptoms of the disorder, providing benefits to attention, focus, motivation, and impulse control.	"Typical medications for adhd don't increase production of dopamine. They act on mobilizing what you already make, getting it into action between nerves. Medications that actually increase dopamine synthesis are instead used for parkinson's, where there's actually a loss of dopamine-producing cells. They don't work well for adhd. ---------------------------------------------edit: some more information as there's often a lot of curiosity around similar questions. Basically, while many psychiatric problems seem to involve some sort of alterations in how the brain uses various neurotransmitters to function, none are as simple as ""too little of this"" or ""too much of that. "" (classic narcolepsy, on the other hand, actually does involve destruction of cells that produce a neurotransmitter called orexin or hypocretin; parkinson's, as above, involves loss of dopamine neurons. That said, both can involve psychiatric symptoms. )dopamine in particular is a curious chemical, which the brain and body use for many different functions, and where the timing/size/location of a dopamine signal can make a lot of difference. For instance, unless you're breastfeeding or taking certain medications right now, dopamine is constantly, 24/7/365, telling part of your brain not to fire up milk production. (you've been taking it for granted, all these years. ) in other areas, dopamine has curious roles involve movement, reward/prediction, and motivation. As you can imagine, it's very important that a signal related to movement or reward be timed correctly. Fundamentally, the brain is always trying to figure out ""was that thing I just did good or not, and would the benefit of doing the same thing or another thing be worth the effort and risk? "" it's sometimes described as a pleasure molecule but that's probably not very accurate, and other neurotransmitters probably have a stronger role. Researchers have modeled adhd around failure of the frontal cortex (the part of the brain that's supposed to take charge and connect behavior to goals) to use neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine to adequately rein in the rest of the brain, probably with related alterations in reward processing. This doesn't tell us everything, but as a working model it helps connect symptoms that might not otherwise seem related but show up together, like inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity."

Scratching eczema or irritated skin feels good and provides relief in the moment because it temporarily distracts the brain from the itch sensation by creating a mild pain sensation. When we scratch, our nerves send mixed signals to the brain, making it difficult for the brain to focus on the itchiness alone. It's like momentarily drowning out the annoying itch with a more intense feeling. Think of it like listening to music with different tunes. Itchiness is a quieter and more irritating tune, while scratching is a louder, more attention-grabbing tune. When the louder tune starts playing, your brain becomes more focused on processing it, making you feel relief from the irritation. However, scratching actually worsens the skin condition because it causes inflammation, damages the skin's barrier, and increases the risk of infection. The damaged skin becomes even more sensitive and vulnerable, causing a vicious cycle: more itchiness and more scratching. In summary, scratching eczema feels good in the moment because it distracts the brain from itchiness by creating a mild pain sensation. But it's a short-term relief that comes at the cost of long-term damage to your skin.	This actually has 2 answers. The instant feel goods come from overriding the itch signals with literally any other stimulus. This overriding can be so pleasurable to the brain that it can make other forms of pain actually feel good. This is because an itch signal is in place so you do scratch because it is ment to help the human body realize there is something irritating the skin that needs to quickly be removed before it causes more serious damage (although the brain is easily tricked and the itch response is often triggered by things that won't be helped by scratching). The other reason it can feel so good is because intense scratching can temporary release some histamine (the itchy chemical) from the itchy area. This temporary relieves the itch, but because of the damage caused by the scratching, more histamine is produced and makes you even more itchy after. Edit:damn, guess y'all really wanted to know why scratching an itch feels so damn good.
467	e203478e-9d74-4205-b8da-fe4dd877aa70.txt	Why does seafood seem to spoil so quick?	Seafood spoils quickly due to its high water content and presence of enzymes, bacteria, and microorganisms. These factors create an ideal environment for bacterial growth and decomposition. When seafood is exposed to air, these bacteria multiply rapidly, breaking down proteins and releasing unpleasant odors. Additionally, seafood is more susceptible to spoilage than other meats because it is often caught in warmer waters, which promotes bacterial growth. To prevent spoilage, it's important to store seafood at cold temperatures and consume it as quickly as possible.	Most sea creatures contain a molecule called trimethylamine oxide (tmao) in their flesh. The molecule helps balance their internal salt levels against the high concentration of salt in the water. It also helps with stabilizing proteins. Tmao will break down (oxidize) when in contact with oxygen in the air. The oxidized chemicals produce the fishy smell for seafood that has been left out for too long and has spoiled. Note that freshwater fish have much lower concentrations of tmao so they don't smell as strongly when left out.

Causation means one event directly causes another, like flipping a light switch causes the light to turn on. Correlation is when two events seem related but one doesn't necessarily cause the other, like people buying more ice cream on hot days and more people swimming – the ice cream doesn't cause people to swim.	On a day where lots of people were using umbrellas, more people than usual showed up wet at work. There is a clear correlation between those 2 events (they both occur a lot on the same days) but there is no causation, as umbrellas do not cause you to get wet.

At the cellular, or whatever level, what is actually happening to make the muscle “tired”? In nearly every case there’s remaining energy in the body that can burned / expended. What happens during recovery for the muscle to become usable again?	[here is a useful diagram](http://energysystemsandtaekwondo.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/5/0/30508674/1401773530. Jpg) of how muscles obtain their energy for efforts of different lengths. Muscles run on atp (a chemical that stores energy), everything else is a means of producing atp. Your muscle gets tired when it either:1. Is low on energy/atp (this is when you need to catch your breath or rest for a minute) or2. It has been physically damaged by activity and needs time to repair (this is when you have to take a rest day or two)focusing on the atp/energy part your muscles have enough atp for a few seconds of exertion max, afterwards they will need to make more atp. The fastest method is with phosphocreatine which replenishes atp almost instantly, this too runs out after a few more seconds, it's also what creatine supplements aim to maximize. Next comes anaerobic metabolism, this burns sugar without the need for oxygen and produces lactic acid which makes your muscles burn. But at some point this too fails because too much lactic acid has built up and the chemical reactions can no longer proceed forward. Aerobic metabolism using the mitochondria then kicks in and can run indefinitely. However it is limited by how much oxygen is available so it cant provide as much peak energy as the other forms mentioned previously. As a result limitations in o2 delivery to the muscle will make it feel tired as it cannot meet the energy demands you are asking it to meet. Irl all of these processes happen simultaneously but after prolonged exercise you are limited by o2 intake/delivery and feel fatigued. During recovery the muscle has to replenish all of those energy sources. It has to metabolize the lactic acid and/or send it to the liver to be metabolized. It has to replenish creatine phosphate and carbohydrate stores, and it has to repair damage to the muscle by building new proteins to replace the damaged protein fibers.	"When a muscle gets ""tired,"" it essentially means that it's struggling to produce the force needed for a specific task due to a temporary decrease in its efficiency. This occurs at the cellular level and involves various processes, such as the build-up of waste products, depletion of energy sources, and reduced ability to contract. Recovery is the process where the muscle regains its strength and efficiency, which involves clearing waste products, replenishing energy stores, and restoring normal contractions. One contributing factor to muscle fatigue is the build-up of waste products, such as lactic acid, in the muscle cells. As you use your muscles, they produce lactic acid as a byproduct of breaking down glucose for energy. When the levels of lactic acid rise, they interfere with a muscle's ability to contract properly. It's similar to clogging the pipes in a plumbing system – if too much waste accumulates, water doesn't flow as efficiently. Another factor is the depletion of energy sources. Your muscle cells store energy in the form of atp (adenosine triphosphate), which is used to fuel contractions. As you use your muscles, the atp supply decreases, and the muscles eventually struggle to produce enough force for the task. Imagine trying to power a flashlight with a nearly dead battery; the light will be dimmer and eventually turns off when there's no more energy available. During recovery, your body works to restore the muscle's function by removing waste products, such as lactic acid, through the bloodstream. This is similar to a cleaning crew taking away the garbage and debris after a big event. Additionally, your body replenishes the energy stores, such as atp, in the muscle cells. This would be like replacing the dead battery in the flashlight with a fresh, fully charged one. As these processes take place, the muscle gradually regains its strength and efficiency. In summary, muscle fatigue happens when a series of processes at the cellular level cause a temporary decrease in the muscle's ability to produce force. Recovery involves clearing waste products, replenishing energy stores, and restoring the muscle's normal contractions, allowing it to regain strength and efficiency."

When peanuts are chopped up finely, their solid structure remains mostly intact. However, grinding them applies more pressure and friction, which generates heat and breaks down the cell walls, releasing their natural oils. These oils mix with the peanut particles, creating a smooth, pasty texture known as peanut butter. So, it's the heat and pressure from grinding that turns the dry peanuts into a paste.	Peanuts have the same amount of oil in them, no matter if they're whole, chopped, or ground. With that in mind, think of them like sponges. The inside holds the oil, and so appears dry when they're whole, but as the peanut particles get smaller, the internal oil is pushed out, resulting in a more oily, and finally pasty, consistency.

I'd be focusing on what I'm doing then suddenly it feels like my eyes shake for 1-2 seconds then I have to look back and ""refocus"" my eyes. It causes me to have to pause for a moment and happens more often when I'm wearing my glasses. This happens to my friend as well also when she is drawing but she doesn't wear glasses."	"When you focus on something up close, your eye muscles work together to maintain a clear image. This is called convergence. Sometimes, your eye muscles might get tired or have difficulty coordinating, causing your eyes to shake or ""glitch. "" this involuntary eye movement is called nystagmus. Wearing glasses may affect how your eye muscles work together, making it more likely for this to happen. Taking breaks and adjusting your position or focusing distance can help reduce the stress on your eye muscles, preventing these shaking moments and improving your ability to concentrate on your task."

We feel warm when our body needs to either produce less heat or dissipate it more efficiently (by sweating or changing the blood circulation pattern). So we feel warm at lower than body temperature, when the natural metabolic rate of our body produces more heat that can be dissipated without extra effort such as sweating. What we call feeling cold or warm is not a measure of the temperature, it is a signal for our body to modify behavior to keep its temperature constant. &#x200b;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/377814/why-do-we-feel-hot-when-temperature-is-relatively-high-even-though-it-might-be-l#:\~:text=so%20we%20feel%20warm%20at,extra%20effort%20such%20as%20sweating.	When we feel hot, it's because our body is trying to maintain its optimal temperature (around 98. 6°f). Our body cools down by sweating and radiating heat. If the air temperature is lower than our internal temperature, but still warm (e.g. , 90°f), it becomes less efficient for our body to lose heat, as the air can't absorb it as quickly. This slower heat transfer can make us feel hot even though the air temperature is technically lower than our internal body temperature.

Whitening toothpaste helps remove surface stains, but can't change the natural color of your teeth. Factors like genetics, age, and diet can influence the color. To achieve super white teeth, you'd need professional whitening treatments that use stronger agents to reach deeper layers of the tooth. However, maintaining good oral hygiene with your regular toothpaste will still help prevent discoloration and keep your teeth healthy.	"Because ""whitening"" is more marketing than science and because a natural, healthy tooth color is not brilliant white, its a bit off white more like an eggshell or ivory. A lot of the ultra-whites you see on celebrities, influencers and such involve whitening treatments or porcelain veneers. There are also staining habits, like coffee, which could play in but ""super white"" isn't really natural."

"When we sleep, our bodies go through a restorative process that helps to boost our immune system, repair damaged cells and tissues, and restore our energy levels. This is why sleep is essential for recovering faster from illness. During sleep, our body releases specific proteins called cytokines, which play a crucial role in the immune response. These proteins help to fight off infections and inflammation, making it easier for our bodies to heal from sickness. Additionally, sleep allows the brain to clear waste products, further promoting recovery and overall health. Taking ""forced sleep"" through sleeping pills might not have the same restorative effect as natural sleep. While sleeping pills can help us fall asleep, they usually work by suppressing the central nervous system, which can affect the quality of sleep. As a result, sleeping pills may not provide the same restorative benefits and could even disrupt the crucial stages of sleep needed for healing, especially if used frequently or for long periods. In summary, sleep is essential for recovery from illness because it enables our bodies to release important immune-boosting proteins, repair damaged cells, and restore our energy levels. While sleeping pills can help you fall asleep, they might not have the same restorative effect as natural sleep, potentially hindering the healing process."	We have no pills that force you to sleep — we’ve only diversified our portfolio of ways to give your brain increasingly impolite suggestions that it ought to go to sleep immediately. All of them are merely ways of encouraging that transition into the regular state of sleep (though many of them can decrease the quality of that sleep, for sure — both antihistamines and thc, the active component in cannabis, are good at persuading you to sleep, but not so good for favorable sleep brainwaves). As for why sleeping is good for sickness — when you’re awake, your body is doing all sorts of stuff to keep you alive, conscious, and aware of your environment. It is also digesting your food, moving your muscles, etc. — all kinds of stuff, in addition to fighting an infection if you have one. When you’re asleep, the body has a lot less stuff to do at once, and energy is more efficiently directed towards fighting off infections. It’s also less likely that energy is diverted away from immune processes and toward digesting chicken noodle soup, for example.

The reason we have complex dietary requirements is because our bodies need various nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to function properly. These nutrients help with growth, maintaining body functions, and preventing diseases. Our ancestors didn't necessarily have extremely well balanced diets, but they adapted to obtain the necessary nutrients from the available food sources. The human body is capable of synthesizing some nutrients, but not all. These essential nutrients must be obtained from our diet, and that's why we have diverse dietary needs. Our ancestors, like modern humans, needed carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals to survive. Thousands of years ago, people's diets varied, depending on their geographic location and the resources available. For example, people living in coastal regions had access to fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, while inhabitants of inland areas relied more on plant-based diets. Throughout history, humans have evolved and adapted to different diets; our digestive system and metabolic processes have been shaped by the types of food available in our environments. Our ancestors faced food scarcity and limited food choices. They didn't have the luxury of designing well-balanced diets, but their bodies had to stay healthy despite this. When nutrient-rich food was available, they consumed it, and the human body adapted to store excess nutrients for times when food was scarce. This adaptability has allowed humans to survive in various environments and circumstances across the planet.	We have complex dietary requirements if the success criteria is 'achieve best possible state of health. ' we have very simple dietary requirements if the success criteria is just 'don't die. ' and this makes a lot of sense - we are evolved to be generalist omnivores, able to take advantage of lots of different nutrition sources when they are available. Our ancestors probably had balanced diets over the long run, because they would have eaten a lot of different foods whenever they were available, but day to day they would have seen a lot of lean times and days when the meal of the day was just 'whatever we have. ' it also depends on which periods of history and which places you're talking about. Ancient hunter-gatherers would have eaten a variety of wild plants, fruits, meat when it was available. While some historical societies would have subsisted almost completely on bread, a small amount of meat or fish, and some vegetables. Others would have eaten a lot more meat and dairy, if they were dependent on livestock as their main food source. All of them would have gone through times of famine when they would subsist on very little, and probably suffer from disease as a result.

Essentially, that there could be a tree of life which is completely separate from the one we know about, living unseen and unnoticed on earth. We aren't talking about large or even macroscopic plants and animals, just single celled organisms living pretty much everywhere. We wouldn't notice these organisms exist because we don't really know what to look for, they would potentially have a different chemistry compared to normal life, but there's billions of single celled organisms basically everywhere. The way we meaningfully research populations of single celled organisms is by looking at their biochemistry, we might just be looking at the wrong things. It's an exciting idea because it would mean that life began on earth multiple times, which has important implications on things like the search for life off of earth. It's generally believed to be not very likely though, simply because it's likely one set of biochemistry is going to be more efficient than another, over long time frames we would expect the less efficient chemistry to be outcompeted and eliminated.	A shadow biosphere is a theoretical concept suggesting the existence of a separate group of living organisms on earth that interact with our known biosphere but share a fundamentally different biology or chemistry. Essentially, it is an alternative form of life that could have evolved independently and coexist with our known life forms, without us necessarily realizing it. To understand this concept, imagine an invisible layer of diverse living organisms that exist alongside the animals, plants, and microbes we already know but are fundamentally different due to their unique biochemistry. These organisms could be based on entirely different combinations of molecules, amino acids, or other building blocks of life that we are not familiar with, making it difficult for us to recognize or study them. The idea behind the shadow biosphere is that if life evolved more than once on earth, it could have taken a completely different path and resulted in organisms that are unlike anything we have discovered so far. This hypothesis is still speculative, and there is not yet solid evidence to confirm its existence, but it opens up fascinating possibilities and new directions for research in the field of astrobiology and the search for extraterrestrial life.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing red, scaly patches. Although it often appears symmetrical, this symmetry is not controlled by the skin “knowing” about other affected areas. Instead, it’s due to the genetic predisposition and immune responses being the same throughout the body. If certain areas like elbows or knees are prone to develop psoriasis due to factors like friction or dryness, it's likely that the same factors will affect the counterpart area on the other side of the body. So, the symmetry is a result of similar contributing factors and consistent immune responses on both sides of the body, rather than direct communication between affected skin areas.	Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder of generally unknown origin. However, it is known that damage to skin can cause psoriasis to begin in a particular area. Many parts of the body are symmetrical and damage to them can also be symmetrical. It’s not a perfect explanation as some people have asymmetrical plaques, but typically for an action that isn’t reliant on a dominant/non-dominant orientation (think writing, throwing a ball) the damage is typically symmetrical and can trigger the plaques on both sides of the body. An example could be gloves worn on both hands that rub on the hands and cause psoriasis on both of them. Tldr: similar parts of the body tend to experience similar motions/forces/interactions throughout the day.

They existb4 is also known as adenine b8 is also known as inositol b10 is also known as para amino benzoic acid (paba) b11 is also known as salicylic acid they are no longer considered to meet the definition of a vitamin (not essential for normal growth and nutrition)	B vitamins were originally thought to be one vitamin, but were later discovered to be a group of chemically distinct substances. Some of the originally numbered b vitamins, such as b4, b8, etc. , were reclassified or found to be non-essential, so the gaps in the numbering system remain.

Towards the end I always find them clutching the straps of my backpack. Why?	Most people out there hike with incorrectly tied backpacks. The pack is supposed to be tightly secured on the hips and only lightly resting on your shoulders. 80% of the weight is meant to be lifted by your legs. People will instead rest a heavy backpack entirely on the shoulders, which causes stress on your torso/spine and hunches your body. Over the course of a long hike your shoulders and back are going to get wrecked. As to why it is easier to hold the straps up, you are temporarily moving the strain from the muscles in the shoulders and back to your arms. This gives some immediate relief, but isn't going to last.	When hikers get tired, their posture tends to change and muscles become fatigued. Holding the straps of the backpack provides additional support to the upper body by allowing the arm muscles to share the weight of the backpack with the shoulders and back muscles. This helps redistribute the load and reduce the strain on the already tired muscles. Additionally, pulling the backpack closer to the body improves balance and stability, making it easier to maintain proper posture. By clutching the straps, your body is automatically adjusting to reduce fatigue and maintain equilibrium, allowing you to continue hiking with less discomfort.

"Lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide) affects the brain by interacting with serotonin receptors, which play a role in mood, perception, and cognition. It specifically binds to the 5-ht2a receptor, causing neurons to fire abnormally, altering the way your brain processes your surroundings. This leads to changes in thoughts, emotions, and sensory perception, causing the ""high"" experienced by users. This can manifest as hallucinations, distorted time perception, and the blending of senses, known as synesthesia."	So your brain commuicates with itself via neurotransmitters and specific recepticles for those neurotransmitters, called receptors. Lsd specifically interacts with a receptor that is normally reserved for serotonin ( affects mood, sleep, digestion, and a lot of other functions). Having the lsd bind to these receptors is what causes the effects one experiences. Specifially, mood alteration, confused sense of time, confusion of the senses (hearing colour, tasting sound, called synesthesia), visual and auditory hallucinations, etc.

It seems logical to me that taking an anti-inflammatory medication would help the symptoms of an inflammatory disease.	Nsaids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are generally helpful for reducing inflammation. However, for people with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), nsaids can be harmful. This is because they can restrict the blood flow to the gut lining and increase intestinal permeability, making inflammation worse. It's like trying to put out a fire with a hose, but the hose accidentally sprays gasoline instead of water, further fueling the fire.	Nsaids are notorious for causing gastrointestinal ulceration/bleeds. People with diseases such as crohn’s/ulcerative colitis are already at an increased risk for gi bleeding due to the increased levels of inflammation in the gut walls - adding an nsaid into the mix will increase that risk further. Apparently nsaids can also cause acute flares of ibd, though there’s lots of conflicting snd inconclusive evidence.

[here’s a 2021 meta analysis in a peer reviewed journal that looked at animal vs plant protein. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7926405/)“a total of 18 articles were selected for systematic review, of which, 16 were used for meta-analysis. Total protein intakes were generally above the recommended dietary allowance at the baseline and end of intervention. Results from the meta-analyses demonstrated that protein source did not affect changes in absolute lean mass or muscle strength. However, there was a favoring effect of animal protein on percent lean mass. Ret had no influence on the results, while younger adults (<50 years) were found to gain absolute and percent lean mass with animal protein intake (weighted mean difference (wmd), 0. 41 kg; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0. 08 to 0. 74; wmd 0. 50%; 95% ci 0. 00 to 1. 01). Collectively, animal protein tends to be more beneficial for lean mass than plant protein, especially in younger adults. ”note that the analysis showed protein source had no effect in absolute lean mass or muscle strength, but animal protein had a (small) favorable effect on absolute lean mass in adults < 50 years (literally less than a pound). Bottom line and my interpretation: for 99. 9% of people it makes no difference whatsoever. If you are a professional body builder competing to be the very best and rely on small nutritional advantages to eke out a victory you will probably opt for animal protein - but again, not relevant for 99. 9% of people. Edit to address a few of the replies: please see subreddit rules 4 (explain to laypeople, not actual 5 year olds) and 5 (eli5 is for factual information, not opinions)	Animal protein is generally considered more effective at building muscle than plant-based protein because it contains a more complete amino acid profile and higher amounts of essential amino acids, which are crucial for muscle growth and repair. Proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids that our body needs to function, and 9 of them are essential, meaning our body can't produce them so we have to get them through our diet. When it comes to muscle growth, these essential amino acids are especially important, particularly one called leucine, which triggers muscle protein synthesis (the process of building muscle). Most animal-based proteins (like meat, dairy, and eggs) are complete proteins, meaning they contain all 9 essential amino acids in adequate amounts. This makes it easier for our body to utilize these proteins for muscle-building purposes. On the other hand, plant-based proteins (like beans, lentils, and most grains) are usually incomplete, lacking one or more of the essential amino acids. This means that, when relying solely on plant-based sources, you would need to combine different protein sources to ensure you get all the essential amino acids in the required amounts. Additionally, the bioavailability of protein (how efficiently our body can use the protein we eat) tends to be higher in animal-based protein compared to plant-based protein. This is due to factors such as the digestibility of the protein and the presence of other nutrients that can help or hinder protein absorption. However, this doesn't mean that it's impossible to build muscle on a plant-based diet. By consuming a variety of plant-based protein sources (like legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains) and ensuring adequate overall protein intake, it's possible to meet the body's amino acid requirements and achieve muscle growth. In conclusion, animal protein is generally better at building muscle than plant-based protein because it has a more complete amino acid profile, higher amounts of essential amino acids, and is more bioavailable. However,

Everything has a cost. Arms and legs make up a pretty large percentage of a human's mass, way more than that of a typical insect. Because they are larger they have more mass and require more muscles to move them. More muscles moving means more caloric intake is required. Higher order animals usually have things like toes and fingers that bugs don't have and using these requires more brain power than a bug's feet typically have. Larger animals have things like tendons, muscles, joints, etc. Which bugs don't have, making their limbs stronger and more resilient. In-short - the extra food and brain power required doesn't outweigh the occasional benefit having an extra arm would give.	Having more limbs might seem advantageous, but for larger animals like mammals, reptiles, or birds, having four limbs works best due to their body structure and energy efficiency. These bigger animals have evolved over millions of years to have an internal skeleton, which provides support and protection for their internal organs. Having more limbs would require a more complex skeletal and muscular system, which would need more energy to maintain and move. In contrast, smaller creatures like insects have an external skeleton (exoskeleton) that supports their numerous limbs, and they expend less energy due to their smaller size. So, for larger animals, having four limbs is a balance between energy efficiency and mobility.

"The ""wave"" of nausea before vomiting is your body activating its ""emergency exit"" mechanism. The stomach's muscles contract, which causes the feeling of nausea. This sensation signals your brain that something is potentially harmful and needs to be removed. Your brain then sends a message to your stomach to start the vomiting process, using muscles in the diaphragm and abdomen to expel the contents forcefully."	It's partly psychological; you recognize the signs of upcoming vomit, you associate that with being sickpartly it's because your blood pressure drops, leading to a sensation similar to how you can get dizzy if you stand up too quicklypartly it's because your body creates adrenaline when you vomit, and adrenaline does make you feel nausea if you are not otherwise distracted

[this](https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/images/wildlife/birds/mallard/mallardwithducklings. Jpg) is what wild ducklings look like. [this](https://www.cacklehatchery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red-jungle-fowl-scaled. Jpg) is what wild junglefowl chicks look like. The bright yellow colors you are familiar with are the result of artificial selection by humans. People like domestic animals with unusual colors and often selectively breed for those colors. This has resulted in a wide variety of ducks and chickens which differ in color from their wild relatives. Since the same genetic mechanisms tend to control color in adults and offspring, this changes the color of the chicks, too. And because they are protected from predators, they don't need to be camouflaged. Here's a [chart](https://survivalexicon.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/standard-breeds-chart1. Jpg) showing various chicken breeds along with their chicks. Note that the bright yellow chicks come from the white breeds... Neither the adults nor the offspring have dark coloration. And also notes that lots of domestic chickens do have dark colors... They just aren't featured in photos as much. Ducks are very similar, I just couldn't find a chart showing adults next to offspring.	Baby chickens (chicks) and ducklings are bright yellow due to the pigments in their fluffy down feathers, which help them blend in with their natural environment. While it might seem counterintuitive because yellow stands out against many backgrounds, this coloration actually serves as a form of camouflage. In a natural setting, such as a grassy field or an area with straw and hay, yellow chicks and ducklings are less noticeable. The sunlit areas create a variety of yellow tones and shadows, making it harder for predators to spot them. This is especially true when they're huddled together, as their yellow down creates an illusion of a single mass or a patch of sunlight, rather than individual animals. Moreover, the chicks and ducklings don't stay bright yellow for long. As they grow, their downy feathers are replaced with a more subdued coloration that blends better with their habitat, further enhancing their ability to camouflage. In summary, the bright yellow color of baby chickens and ducklings helps them blend in with a variety of natural environments, making them less visible to potential predators.

Will this be, somewhat advantageous, if we are talking about recovery to injures related to lost of blood?"	Not really. No. After you donate blood there is a temporary boost to the production of new red blood cells as your body signals a lack of oxygen. But once that blood is restored, the production of red blood cells goes back to normal. And doing it repeatedly doesn’t really change anything. It is not like a muscle you can make stronger.	When you donate blood regularly, your body adapts by producing new blood cells more efficiently, but not necessarily faster. This improved efficiency may have minor advantages for recovery from blood-related injuries, but it wouldn't be a significant increase. The primary benefit of regular blood donation is maintaining optimal blood volume, which can lead to better overall health and circulation.

It put me out so fast, it felt like I got violently dragged into sleep. Immediately after I saw that white liquid being injected in my vein, I passed out."	"It doesn't really ""put you to sleep"" so much as interrupt the chemical interactions of your brain cells and just stops your brain from being able to work. So in a sense your brain has been forcefully ""shut down"" and cannot remember what happened. You're usually not asleep yet but you will not remember. You know how anesthesia may ask you to count down or count up? Usually patients will remember counting from 1-5 and then they think they passed out but actually they counted to 10-15 but just don't remember it."	Propofol is a powerful anesthetic that works rapidly because it quickly reaches the brain and affects the central nervous system. It targets specific receptors in your brain responsible for sedation and relaxation. Once injected, propofol enters your bloodstream and travels to the brain within seconds. The result is a rapid, deep sleep that feels abrupt. The swift action of propofol makes it ideal for medical procedures, reducing patients' anxiety and allowing doctors to achieve the desired level of sedation effectively and efficiently.

"We need food in the stomach for some medicines because it can help in their absorption or reduce side effects like stomach irritation. The presence of food slows down the drug's movement into the bloodstream, preventing it from causing discomfort. There isn't a specific ""best food,"" but a light meal rich in fiber and easy to digest, like toast or yogurt, is generally a good choice before taking medicine."	Most of the time when a medication is to be taken with food, is because the medication itself stimulates the secretion of stomach acid. If you are making stomach acid but have nothing in your stomach to digest, you get gastritis and reflux. In bad cases it leads to stomach ulcers. Any food is generally fine, just something for that acid to digest.

Warts need their own blood vessels because they are caused by a virus (hpv) that stimulates the growth of skin cells, requiring nutrients and oxygen to grow. Blood vessels, including veins, supply these essentials. As the wart grows, nearby blood vessels branch out into it. This process is called angiogenesis, which is a natural response to new tissue growth. Blood vessels grow towards the wart by producing proteins that create new pathways, fueling the wart's development.	Warts consist of human cells, so they need nutrients and oxygen and that means blood. Veins are not branching out, the blood vessels that transport blood the last distance are called capillaries and the creation of new capillaries is a fairly normal process. A cell suffers from oxygen deprivation. It sends out special hormones that signals this and as a response nearby bloodvessels start to manufacture new capillaries in that area until the cell stops calling out.

The organs inside the chest cavity and stomach don't require full or any symmetry. A long symmetric intestinal tract is practically impossible and organs of which we only need a single one can't all accumulate right in the center of the body, so, over time, they shifted to one of the sides where there was space for them and that's where we have them now.	The human body's exterior symmetry helps with balance and movement, while the internal asymmetry allows for efficient organization of organs. The heart is on the left side to optimize blood circulation, as the left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. The stomach's position on the left allows it to work effectively with the liver, which is on the right side, processing and distributing nutrients. This internal arrangement maximizes space usage and lets various organs work together efficiently.

Wouldn't it have been disadventageous to be so picky about food back when we were still hunting?	Feeling disgust towards certain foods is an evolutionary mechanism that helps humans avoid potentially harmful substances. Our ancestors needed to identify rotten, poisonous, or disease-carrying foods to survive. Some foods, like tripe and eyes, are more likely to harbor harmful pathogens, so we instinctively feel repulsed by them. This didn't make early humans picky eaters, but rather, it helped them prioritize safer food choices for better health. Our modern disgust can be culturally influenced too, as some societies consume tripe and eyes without issue, having grown up with different food norms.	There's advantage to disgust - it prevents us from eating things which could be unsafe to eat. The disgust at things like organ meats is tied into disgust at certain smells, or visuals (like pus, moldy food, maggots, etc. ) that prevent people from eating spoiled meat. We see this behavior in animals as well - a lot of predators won't (or rarely will) eat meat which they haven't killed themselves, because something that died of natural causes is likely to have died from an infection, or may have died too long ago to still be good, etc.

The mother absorbs those cues via the breast and the body responds by producing more antibodies in the breast milk, helping the baby fight off the disease. Since the mother has the advantage of a more mature immune system, she has a greater ""database"" of antibodies to provide. Its just one of several fascinating feedback mechanisms in breastfeeding."	Breast milk adapts to a baby's needs when they are sick by increasing antibodies and nutrients. When a baby feeds, their saliva interacts with the mother's nipple, signaling for specific antibodies to be produced. The mother's body then adjusts the composition of the breast milk, increasing immune-boosting components like white blood cells and proteins. This personalized immune response helps the baby recover faster from illness and strengthens their overall immune system.

Im not sure if the title made sense but how babies cry to communicate, did they do that in the like prehistoricy times. Cause I refuse to believe that people who were surrounded by bears, moose, just aggressive/kill you quick wild life, lived with screaming babies around.	Animals don’t go around attacking everything in sight. Every fight they get into is a risk they could get hurt. Getting hurt means losing their ability to hunt. No more hunting means starving to death. Animals only go after prey they think they have a good chance of taking down with minimal injury risk to themselves. Even in prehistoric times a wolf, lion, etc. Could figure out that a loud baby human likely meant there would be a group of larger adult humans nearby with spears and fire. Not worth the risk. It’s the same reason in modern times if you see a cute bear cub while out hiking, you don’t just go pet it. You get away quickly. Because baby bear means angry momma bear somewhere close.	In prehistoric times, people lived in small groups which helped them survive in dangerous environments. When babies cried, adults were always close by to quickly respond to their needs, which often kept the crying to a minimum. Additionally, mothers would carry their babies close to their bodies, allowing for constant comfort, warmth, and quick nursing. Babies were also more likely to cry when they were in a safe and secure environment, like inside a shelter or surrounded by their group members. The close-knit communities worked together to ensure the safety of the babies and the entire group. So, even though crying could potentially attract predators, the support and quick responses from the group were enough to minimize risks and help them survive in their dangerous surroundings.

Like for example riding a bicycle, and we lose some, like a new language we learned 10 years ago but can’t remember anything about it now?	The main difference between retaining certain skills like riding a bicycle and losing others like a language comes down to two types of memory: procedural memory and declarative memory. Procedural memory is responsible for motor skills, habits, and actions, such as riding a bike or tying your shoes. Once you learn these tasks, the memory is stored in a part of your brain called the basal ganglia. These tasks don't require conscious thought to perform, and the memory remains strong with long-term practice. Think of it like riding a bike; once you learn the balance and movements, it becomes automatic. Declarative memory, on the other hand, is responsible for storing facts or experiences. Learning a language relies heavily on declarative memory as it involves remembering vocabulary, grammar rules, and cultural nuances. This type of memory is stored in the hippocampus, which requires active recall to maintain information over time. In summary, we retain skills like riding a bike because those memories are stored as automatic, procedural memories, while we may lose knowledge like a language because we need active recall to maintain that information as declarative memory.	"Not a psychologist, but I took a minor course in psychology. Basically, your brain has two broad types of memory:1) procedural: this includes skills, like riding a bike, driving a car, and so on. 2) declarative: facts, figures, and about everything else. This does ""erode"" over time, that is, more relevant information at the time overtakes something learned in the past. To answer your question:procedural memory is tied to motor skills and doesn't get ""replaced"" (bit of a misnomer) unlike declarative memory. So the language is still there, it just takes time and eventually pops up, whilst you'll never forget how to ride a bike. Hope this helped. Edit: thank you for the upvotes and especially u/thelostecholar for the award. Glad I could help out a little. Edit 2: well, I'm glad this is my most upvoted comment. Thank you u/jaywiz8 and u/-snug- for the awards, and the rest of you awesome people for continuing an awesome discussion. It's lovely."
495	a843a942-1829-4576-a70a-de6915ba55be.txt	What it means to “process“ your emotions?	Processing your emotions refers to the act of understanding, working through, and managing your feelings in a healthy and constructive manner. It involves acknowledging your emotions, examining their origins, and learning from them to better cope with similar situations in the future. Imagine emotions as a tangled ball of yarn. To process them, you would gradually unwind and separate each strand (emotion) to gain a better understanding of the patterns and reasons behind the tangle. This can help you identify triggers, reactions, and possible solutions that could prevent or alleviate future emotional tangles. One common approach to process emotions is through introspection, where you spend time reflecting on your emotions, thoughts, and experiences. This may involve evaluating your reactions to certain situations, identifying patterns in your behavior, and understanding any underlying beliefs or values that may be contributing to your emotions. Another important aspect of processing emotions is expressing them. This can be done in various ways, such as talking with trusted friends or family members, journaling or writing, engaging in creative outlets like art, music, or dance, or even seeking professional help from a mental health professional, like a therapist or counselor. Processing emotions is significant because it promotes emotional well-being, self-awareness, and leads to healthier relationships with yourself and others. By understanding and managing your emotions, you can become more receptive to feedback, deal with conflicts more effectively, and improve your communication skills. Furthermore, processing emotions contributes to personal growth by helping you develop resilience, adapt better to life's challenges, and reduce the risk of excessive stress or anxiety that may result from unaddressed emotions. It is important to note that processing emotions can be an ongoing and sometimes challenging task. Emotions are complex, and you may experience multiple emotions at once or encounter recurring emotions. Regularly checking in with yourself, practicing self-reflection, and seeking support when needed can help you continuously navigate and process your emotions in a healthy and constructive manner.	For me: start with the most basic understanding of what you’re feeling right now, and try to identify the why from it. “i’m annoyed because…”usually, the base feeling isn’t all that’s going on—you’re rarely just annoyed, just angry, just disappointed, with nothing behind that. So once you’ve named the base emotion and source, the next step is identifying why the source is triggering the base emotion—yeah, really. “i’m annoyed because we had made plans, and now the plans are changing. I’m no longer sure what’s going on, so i’m having a hard time planning the rest of the afternoon with the new schedule. Ohhhhhh—i’m annoyed at this change because it’s making me anxious. ”boom, new emotion. Okay, so now we know we’re responding to a situation that’s making us anxious by expressing annoyance. In order to deal with the annoyance, we *actually* have to deal with the anxiety first—so the next step is to identify what you need in a given moment to resolve the root feeing. “i’m anxious about our plans changing because I expected the day to look one way, and now I don’t know what the day looks like. I need the new plans to be expressed clearly so that I can recalibrate my expectations for the day. ”once we identify the thing we’re feeling, cause of what we’re feeling, and any root emotions *behind* those feelings, it’s a lot easier to work from the bottom up to manage the whole situation. The feeling of annoyance is processed by understanding exactly what we’re annoyed about and, with that knowledge, identifying and taking actionable steps to resolve the situation. Processing doesn’t always mean “making the feeling go away,” it can also mean “gaining a better understanding of the feeling and situation,” but that’s how I usually approach it

Yes, it's somewhat realistic. When someone is shot in the chest, the bullet can damage their lungs, leading to internal bleeding. Blood from the damaged lung may be coughed up and come out of the person's mouth, since the respiratory system is connected to the mouth. This occurrence is called hemoptysis, which is the medical term for coughing up blood.	If they were shot in the lungs then the lung would fill with blood and blood would come up with every breath, however in movies its used as a symbol that this person is going to die in a minute but they might be able to get a few words out to advance the movie plot.
497	2e055904-7ac6-435d-b288-1bc4affac734.txt	When scientists say babies have blurred vision, how do they know?	Babies having blurred vision is determined by scientists through a combination of understanding the developmental stages of the human eye, observing infant behavior, and conducting scientific experiments. The human eye is not fully developed at birth. Key parts of the eye, such as the retina, lens, and muscles, continue to grow and develop during the first few months of life. This leads scientists to deduce that a baby's vision is not as sharp as an adult's, simply because their eyes are not yet fully formed. Observation of infants also provides clues about their vision. For example, babies tend to focus on objects that are closer to them, as their distance vision is still developing. They also show a preference for high-contrast patterns, making it easier for them to see shapes and outlines. Scientific experiments have been conducted, using methods like preferential looking tests or visual evoked potential tests, to further explore babies' vision capabilities. Preferential looking tests involve showing an infant two different images and observing which one they look at more, giving insight into their ability to see details. Visual evoked potential tests measure the brain's electrical activity in response to specific visual stimuli, like light patterns, to gauge the infant's ability to process visual information. In summary, scientists know that babies have blurred vision through a combination of understanding eye development, observing infant behavior, and conducting experiments.	"You know that machine the eye doctor makes you look into when you first start an eye exam? You look at a little circle with a picture in it (e.g. A picture of a hot air balloon), and the machine goes *whrrrr* *whrrrr* while the picture goes in and out of focus? That's called an [autorefractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autorefractor), and it's able to (mostly) figure out how bad your eyes are all by itself. All the ""which looks better, 1 or 2? "" stuff afterwards is just fine-tuning the prescription from a starting point that the machine figured out. So with babies, they can't do the fine-tuning part of the exam, but they can still look into an autorefractor. This is actually very important for babies. The fine-tuning isn't super important, but if the baby has a very different prescription in one eye than the other, then the baby will start favoring their good eye at the expense of their bad eye. Their brain, as it grows, will literally stop paying attention to their bad eye. If it's not corrected in time, it can cause lifelong vision impairment in the bad eye."

The realization that the mind is in the brain came from observing brain injuries and their effects on mental abilities. Throughout history, people noticed that damage to specific brain areas led to certain mental impairments. For example, if someone experienced a head injury and lost their ability to speak, it suggested that speech was tied to a particular part of the brain. Over time, these observations helped us understand the brain's role in controlling the mind.	Most human cultures large enough to have major medical practices or dedicated healers were able to observe that injuries to the brain can cause changes or impairments to the mind. It took more studies to get a more precise understanding, but the connection between the mind and the brain is pretty intuitive from just what can be observed.

Shouldn't whatever they leave behind be less nutritious after they break it down than it was before?	"Detrivores, like millipedes, break down dead plants and animals into smaller pieces, making it easier for bacteria and fungi to decompose them further. When they eat, they also take in essential nutrients to grow and stay healthy. However, they don't utilize all the nutrients. After digestion, their waste, called ""frass,"" is rich in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Frass mixes with the soil, making it more nutrient-rich for plants to absorb. In summary, detrivores help recycle nutrients in ecosystems by digesting organic matter and returning valuable nutrients to the soil."	Detailed chemistry varies but, in a lot of cases, scavenger animals & plants break down stuff that was previously inaccessible as a nutrient into a form that other organisms can use. So something that the millepede is eating is at least partially digestible to the millipede but not to much else... If the millipede didn't eat it, those nutrients would be locked away and useless to other critters. Millipede eats it and breaks it down into something that some other plant or animal can absorb, and now it's a useful nutrient.

"Our bodies lose unused muscle and not unused fat because of how they prioritize energy storage and usage. Essentially, maintaining muscle is more costly than maintaining fat, so when muscles aren't being used, the body gets rid of them more easily to save energy. Muscles are constantly active and use a lot of energy, even when we're not exercising. In contrast, fat is essentially our body's long-term energy storage, and it doesn't require much energy to maintain. If you don't use your muscles, your body realizes that and thinks, ""hey, I don't necessarily need that extra energy right now, so let's conserve resources! "" this results in muscle atrophy, or a decrease in muscle mass. On the other hand, our bodies hold on to fat because it serves as an important energy reserve. If a situation arises where you need energy quickly (like running from danger or fighting an infection), your body can tap into that fat reserve and convert it into fuel. Since our bodies are designed to prioritize survival, they'll try to hold on to fat as much as possible. So, in short, we lose unused muscle because it's energy-consuming to maintain, and we don't lose unused fat because our bodies view it as a valuable energy resource to be saved for emergencies."	"Because muscle is expensive to maintain, you need to eat a lot of food just to keep the muscles even if you aren't using them. This is not true of fat, it's pretty cheap for your body to maintain when it just sits there. This is important because for 10s of thousands of years food was very scarce for humans. So our bodies evolved to not waste it. Because people that didn't lose unused muscle would starve to death so the gene for ""keep your muscles"" was lost. It's only within the last 100 years or so, and even then only in rich countries, that a ""keep your muscles"" gene wouldn't result in you starving to death after a single tough winter (and they are all tough). Additionally, the entire *point* of fat to stick around until you need it. Before the abundance of food we have now getting rid of unused fat made about as much sense as withdrawing all the money in your savings and burning it because you haven't needed for a couple years now."
501	c82d751f-cce1-4e2b-96d4-7692ff745d78.txt	Why does exercise have such a big impact on the brain? If I go 3 days without exercising, I start experiencing brain fog and get depressed & more anxious. When I workout again, I gain mental clarity, become more motivated to take on the day, and like 75% of the self-deprecating thoughts I experience go away. Why does this happen to me? What's the science behind this?	Exercise has a significant impact on the brain because it promotes the release of various beneficial chemicals and supports overall brain health. When you exercise, your brain experiences increased blood flow, which delivers more oxygen and nutrients to your brain cells, helping them work more efficiently. One of the main chemicals released during exercise is endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood elevators. They help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, contributing to the improved mood and mental clarity you experience after a workout. Exercise also stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), a protein that supports the growth and survival of your brain cells. Bdnf helps to enhance memory and learning, which may contribute to the increased motivation and focus you notice. Moreover, exercise aids in regulating neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, which play crucial roles in mood regulation, motivation, and overall feelings of well-being. Consistent exercise also helps reduce inflammation and supports the growth of new blood vessels in the brain. When you go days without exercising, your brain may experience a reduction in these beneficial chemicals and effects, leading to brain fog, depression, and anxiety. By resuming your workouts, you restore the chemical balance and promote better brain functioning, resulting in improved mental health and cognitive abilities.	Biologically, exercise causes your brain to release neurotransmitters (most importantly dopamine and endorphins). Neurotransmitters basically carry the chemicals that are used to trigger certain feelings, and distributes them throughout your brain. That being said, endorphins can physically lower feelings of stress and pain and increase mood and energy. Dopamine contributes to feelings of pleasure, reward, and satisfaction. Exercise is among the healthiest and most natural ways to trigger the release of these neurotransmitters in your brain. There are also a few much more simple ways that it could help clear up negative feelings. For one, it feels good to be productive. Exercise is productive. When you exercise, you might feel a sense of purpose. And fulfilling that goal gives you an immediate sense of accomplishment for how hard you're working. It also loosens your muscles that are probably otherwise tense from feelings of anxiety and depression while forcing you to breathe more steadily. This reminds your anxious brain that you are safe. Exercising gives you something healthy to focus on. It can interrupt your rumination and anxious thoughts, and refocus your energy onto something real. I think that's a big reason why its clearing up the brain fog and anxiety for you.

"Feline leukemia is caused by a contagious virus (felv) that spreads from cat to cat through body fluids, while human leukemia is a genetic mutation in blood cells. Since viruses are contagious and genetic mutations aren't, feline leukemia can spread between cats while human leukemia cannot be transmitted from person to person. Think of it as feline leukemia being caused by an infectious ""bug,"" whereas human leukemia is like an internal malfunction."	Feline leukemia refers to “feline leukemia **virus**” (felv for short), and because it’s a virus, it is contagious. Although felv *can* cause cancer in cats, it is not a cancer in and of itself. The virus got its name because it was first discovered in cats with leukemia. Human leukemia, on the other hand, refers to the actual blood cancer (and is therefore not contagious).

Killing sharks and whales is more heavily frowned upon than catching crabs, fish, and other marine animals due to a combination of factors including sustainability, ecological roles, and emotional perception. Firstly, sustainability is a major concern, as many shark and whale species have slow reproduction rates, taking a long time to reach maturity and producing few offspring. Overfishing or hunting of these species can drastically reduce their populations, making it difficult for them to recover. In contrast, crabs, fish, and other marine animals generally reproduce more quickly and in larger numbers, which allows their populations to recover more easily from being caught. Secondly, sharks and whales often play significant roles in their ecosystems. For instance, sharks help maintain the balance of the marine food web by feeding on sick, weak, or older organisms. They also help keep prey populations in check, preventing them from overgrazing on the ecosystems they inhabit. Whales also contribute to the marine ecosystem, as their dung provides nutrients that stimulate plankton growth, which forms the base of the marine food web. Removing these top predators from their ecosystems can lead to imbalance and negative impacts, such as the decline of other species. Finally, emotional perception plays a role in the perception of sharks and whales' treatment. Due to their intelligence, social structures, and cultural associations, whales have developed a strong emotional connection with many people. Sharks, though often feared, have also gained a level of respect and admiration as powerful predators. This evokes a greater level of public empathy and concern for their welfare, compared to smaller marine creatures like crabs and fish, which often don't generate the same emotional response. In summary, killing sharks and whales is heavily frowned upon due to concerns about sustainability, the critical ecological roles they play, and the emotional connections people have with these creatures, while catching crabs and fish is more accepted given their higher reproduction rates and lesser emotional appeal.	"This is too simplistic a view of the animal kingdom, but has answers. In general, sharks and whales reproduce slowly, live a long time, and do a lot of work to keep ecosystems under control by eating a lot. Because of ""reproduce slowly"" and ""eat a lot"", they're more likely to be endangered than a lot of things ""below"" them in the food chain. So especially when they are endangered, we discourage people from killing them because it has a big impact on the ecosystem. But crabs? Very few of them are endangered. They produce tons of eggs, I'm seeing search results saying between 750,000 and 3 million per season! But most of those baby crabs die. They get eaten by other things, or get a disease, or don't even manage to hatch. Thing is, though, if there are millions of new baby crabs then letting tens of thousands of people catch them doesn't really put a big dent in the ecosystem. That tends to go for a lot of aquatic creatures. Most exist just to be food for other things. As such, they have huge broods of offspring and the law of large numbers means enough survive to keep the species going. There are some endangered fish we can't catch, and a lot of areas require fishing licenses and have restrictions on what people can catch without releasing. So the same rules apply to those ""smaller"" fish. It's just the way the food chain works we have a ton of those ""smaller"" fish and we have to do something really exceptional to endanger them."

I understand the blood is going places its “not supposed to be” but its still on the inside so whats the deal?	The body can't re-absorb blood during internal bleeding because blood needs to be inside blood vessels to function properly. Once blood spills into surrounding tissues, it can't transport oxygen and nutrients, so it's essentially useless. Instead, our immune system helps clean up the area, and the body regenerates new blood to replace the loss.	Imagine a water pipe burst inside your house, the water is still delivered inside your house, but it is kind of a big deal it's going to where it's not supposed to be. Same with blood - it's supposed to stay inside the pipes running through the body, not just generally inside the body.

I was talking about this with my friend, if we aren’t having periods during this time, the eggs are unfertilised but they aren’t being broken down because we aren’t having periods. So what are they doing?	Hormonal birth control prevents ovulation, which means the ovaries don't release eggs. Without ovulation, there's no egg to be fertilized, so no period occurs. Instead, the eggs remain in the ovaries and get reabsorbed by the body over time, preventing pregnancy from taking place.	Nothing. They simply don't ovulate. A woman has far more eggs in her ovaries than she'll ever use in her lifetime. When she is pregnant, she simply doesn't ovulate for those nine months. Hormonal birth control mimics the pregnancy hormones that limit ovulation, so she simply doesn't ovulate when taking it.

The reason we don’t is for technical, legal, and ethical reasons. Technically, cloning things with large genomes tends to have a non-trivial risk of genetic damage — would it be ethical to create clones if 20% of them were malformed or suffering from genetic diseases. Would it be legal to terminate the defective ones? How about let them live long enough to harvest any good organs for transplants? Could you clone someone else without their consent? As it stands now, laws against human experimentation would prevent human cloning. There are tons of things, not just technical, that need to be addressed before we do it.	Cloning humans is technically possible but faces significant ethical, moral, and safety concerns. In cloning, scientists use a procedure called somatic cell nuclear transfer (scnt) to create a genetic copy of an individual. This involves removing the nucleus from an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus from a somatic cell, then stimulating the egg to create an embryo. Some reasons we don't clone humans are:1. Ethical concerns: many people argue against cloning due to religious, moral, or philosophical beliefs. 2. Safety issues: cloned animals often exhibit health problems and shorter lifespans, raising concerns about the potential risks for cloned humans. 3. Legal restrictions: many countries have laws prohibiting human cloning to protect individuals' rights and to prevent potential exploitation.

Doctors estimate the time a terminally ill patient has left by considering various factors related to the patient's overall health, the specific illness, and past experiences with similar cases. They examine the progression of the disease, the effectiveness of treatments, and the patient's physical and mental condition. Medical professionals may also rely on statistical data, such as survival rates and patterns, to make their predictions. It's important to note that these estimates are not always accurate, as each patient's body and response to treatments can vary significantly. While doctors try their best to provide an informed estimate, it should be understood as a rough guideline rather than a definite timeline.	Imagine taking 100 ice cubes and measuring how long it took for each one to melt on an average day in an average setting. Some would melt a little faster than others and some would melt a little slower. There might an odd ball-out that took a really long time to melt for some reason, maybe the temperature was cold that day. Average all of these together and apply them to an ice cube you haven't seen melt yet and you would have a good guess. You can further refine it based on it's size, how cold it is in the room based on previous observations, etc. It's all a best guess of averages based on those before you.
508	0c892461-99b6-4c2d-b7ab-43b5b058d6ed.txt	Why are our brains not with the other vital organs? They're all in the same part of the body, except the brain. Did the other organs all move together into their location, how did the brain get left out?	It’s an evolutionary answer - the bodies of most animals are essentially a tube with a mouth and an anus. Many early animals were pretty much just this (think of a flat worm) - primitive eyes, olfaction etc developed at the entry end because that’s where they’d be most useful for hunting, movement and so on. As the sensory systems became more developed they required more processing power to make sense of the information they were gathering, forming more and more complex clusters of neurons. Eventually a group of animals called the craniates diverged, wrapping these neuronal clusters in protective layers of tissue and eventually bone, forming early skulls with jaws, eye sockets etc. It’s evolutionary advantageous to have the sensory organs and processing close together, so this set up was pretty stable. Because evolution can’t go back and start again between generations, only tinker with what exists, the basic body plan of almost all animal life, with the sensory organs mostly clustered in one place, became set pretty early on, which is why virtually every animal has that basic set up with its brain separate from its body.	The main reason why the brain is located separately from other vital organs is due to its unique and vital functions, as well as specialized protection. Let's break down the concept step-by-step:1. Function: the brain is the control center of the entire body. It processes information, makes decisions, and sends signals to other organs and muscles. Because of its crucial role, the brain needs to be in a position to easily and quickly communicate with the rest of the body. The head is an ideal location for this as it is at the top of the spinal cord, which acts as a communication highway between the brain and the rest of the body. 2. Protection: the brain is extremely delicate and sensitive, and it needs extra protection that other organs don't require. To ensure its safety, the brain is encased within the skull, which is a strong and protective bone structure. Additionally, the brain is also cushioned by cerebrospinal fluid, which helps protect it from injury by absorbing shocks and providing a stable environment. In contrast, most of the other vital organs are located in the torso, where they are protected by the ribcage and encased within a compact space. This arrangement allows the organs to work efficiently together while also receiving ample protection from potential damage.

The need for protein and other supplements arose due to the increased physical demands of intense workouts and the desire to enhance muscle growth and recovery. Modern diets may lack sufficient nutrients to meet these demands. Supplements gained popularity because they offer a convenient source of concentrated nutrients that can be easily integrated into daily routines, without needing to consume large quantities of specific foods.	Protein powder etc isn’t really much better than milk or chicken for example but if I put milk or chicken in my protein shaker and leave it in my work locker / car all day before going to the gym it’s not going to be as nice to drink as my chocolate drink that I can just add some water to :-)

Our body twitches and spasms, also known as muscle contractions, happen when the nerve cells that control our muscles send out incorrect signals. This is usually due to minor electrical imbalances or miscommunications in our nervous system. One of the main reasons behind these twitches is muscle fatigue. When we use our muscles a lot, like after exercising or performing repetitive tasks, they can get tired and the communication between nerves and muscles gets disrupted, leading to twitching. Another potential reason can be stress, as it can affect our nervous system and cause involuntary responses like twitching or spasms. Additionally, imbalances in minerals like calcium, potassium, and magnesium in our body can also contribute to muscle twitches. Usually, these random twitches are harmless and go away on their own. However, if they are persistent or widespread, it is important to consult a doctor, as it might indicate a more serious underlying issue.	Your brain works by moving salt ions through the cell walls of its neurons. Your muscles work in a similar way. Sometimes, your body gets a little extra salty near one of your nerves (bundles of neurons that carry neural signals between your brain and the rest of your body). That extra salt makes the nerve think that the brain is trying to send a signal (because from the nerve's perspective that's basically impossible to differentiate), so it sends a signal down to the nerve's end. If that nerve happens to be connected to a muscle, then that muscle will twitch. But because the section that started the impulse was only a little extra salty and likely did not hit all neurons in the bundle at the same time, it only makes the muscle twitch a little instead of a big, full muscle flex.

"People who never learned a language generally think using concepts, visuals, emotions, and their physical senses. They don't have words to label or organize their thoughts, but they can still think, process information, and problem-solve. Imagine you're at the beach and you feel the warmth of the sand between your toes, the sound of the waves crashing, and the sight of the sun setting. Even without language, you can still understand and process these experiences. You remember how the sand feels, how the waves sound, and what the sunset looks like, and associate them with the concept of a beach. Similarly, people without language can still make connections and understand their environment through their senses and experiences. For example, when a person without language feels hungry, they understand the physical sensation and know they need to eat, even without having the word ""hungry"" to describe it. They might picture food, remember the sensation of eating, and then act on it by seeking out a meal. Additionally, these individuals can develop their own internal system of communication, such as gestures, facial expressions, or body language. This can help them convey essential information to other people or even interact with their surroundings. In summary, individuals who never learned a language think using a combination of sensations, experiences, emotions, and non-verbal communication methods, forming a mental understanding of their world without words."

The reason why the Nazi flag is more widely forbidden than the imperial Japanese flag in many (online) places, despite the atrocities committed by both, is mainly due to historical context, symbolism, and contemporary usage. Firstly, historical context plays a significant role here. The holocaust and the events of world war ii involving the Nazis have been deeply studied and documented in western countries, with greater emphasis placed on education and remembrance. As a result, the Nazi's atrocities and their symbols, such as the swastika, have become universally recognized as symbols of hate, genocide, and discrimination. In contrast, imperial Japan's war crimes, although horrendous, are not as well-known or documented globally. The lack of similar public awareness and education regarding imperial Japan's actions can contribute to the acceptance of their flag as opposed to the Nazi's flag. Secondly, symbolism is another factor. The Nazi flag, featuring the swastika, is specifically associated with adolf hitler's regime and its heinous crimes. It is a unique symbol directly affiliated with the Nazi party and thus carries strong negative connotations. On the other hand, the imperial Japanese flag, the rising sun flag, has origins predating world war ii and its involvement in warfare. The rising sun symbol has been used across Japanese culture to represent Japan's sun-related deity amaterasu and was adopted as a military flag in the 19th century. This historical link makes the rising sun flag more ambiguous and less controversial than the Nazi flag. Lastly, contemporary usage makes the difference as well. The Nazi flag and its symbol, the swastika, are primarily utilized by hate groups, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Consequently, its usage is almost exclusively tied to promoting and inciting hate. In contrast, the rising sun flag is still used in some aspects of Japanese life without the same negative associations. For example, you can find it on commercial products and at sporting events. In summary, the Nazi flag is more widely forbidden than the imperial Japanese flag due to its strong, unique ties to the Nazi regime, the greater public awareness and education of Nazi crimes, and its continued use by hate groups.	The rising sun flag is older and not exclusively associated with that particular time in history. It is also not outright banned or outlaws in Japan or even places like korea or China. The Nazi flag despite incorporating an ancient buddhist symbol is almost exclusively associated with the Nazis and outright banned in Germany and several other European countries. Companies that make money in places in Europe will want to avoid legal trouble and controversy by self censoring its use. There is less pressure along those line to do the same for the imperial Japanese flag. If it were entirely based on body count, you would have trouble with the british flag too, but unlike a confederate flag or a Nazi flag a modern british flag is not exclusively associated with past crimes against humanity and broadcasting a desire to commit more of them. It is also going to cause far fewer people to complain who have enough money to make the companies care about their complains. Justice and the amount of past wrongs don't figure into it as much as money. If someone displays a Nazi flag they are not just saying they are pro-Nazi, in many place in Europe such a display may be perceived as a threat and announcing a desire to continue what the Nazis did. Death threats are usually not covered under free speech. The imperial Japanese flag may be a sign that someone is racists and nationalists, but does not quite carry the same implied threat of overthrowing the government installing a dictatorship and committing a genocide. So people and authorities get more upset about Nazi symbols than imperial Japanese ones and companies who want to avoid legal troubles and controversies are much more quick to act to stop the former than the latter because of that.

The ancient greeks valued balance and believed that gods and goddesses represented different aspects of life. While they worshipped female deities for their unique powers, in society, they followed traditional gender roles which considered men superior to women. The contrast between goddesses and human women highlighted the divine power of goddesses and reinforced the essential complementary roles of men and women in greek society.	"Because the goddesses weren't human women. They were god-women. They didn't see women as *so* much lesser than men that their goddesses were as ""low"" as humans. And even if they thought goddesses were less powerful than gods, openly stating that about beings who you believe have turned people into spiders for being sassy is not a good idea."

The bronze age came before the iron age mainly because of the technological advancements and resources available at the time. Although iron was more abundant than copper and tin, the process of extracting and smelting iron required much higher temperatures and control than bronze production. Bronze is made by combining copper with a smaller amount of tin, which was easier to obtain and work with, given the lower melting point of these metals. In simple terms, early humans learned how to combine copper and tin to create bronze before they developed the tools and techniques needed to handle the more demanding process of working with iron. As technology advanced and people learned how to smelt iron at higher temperatures, the iron age began, replacing bronze as the primary material for tools and weapons.	Someone can please correct me if i’m wrong here, but basically:copper and tin can both be found naturally occuring in forms that are easy to find, mine and process into metal. They may even be found relatively pure in nature. Iron on the other hand reacts with oxygen, and forms oxides that take immense temperatures to melt in order to separate the iron from the other stuff that makes up the ore. Copper and tin can both melt in relatievly primitive fires fed by coal or wood, where iron smelting requires way more complicated furnaces with continuously supplied air in order to burn the excess carbon out, as well as supply the fire with enough oxygen to burn at a sufficiently hot temperature.

It seems 18 is universally recognized as the age of adulthood and I'm wondering why such a specific number. Why not 20 for example?	The concept of 18 as the age of adulthood has its roots in various historical, social, and cultural factors, but it is not universally recognized across all cultures and societies. The number 18 became more prevalent as the age of adulthood mainly during the 20th century, primarily in western countries, and its adoption can be attributed to several contributing factors. One major reason for choosing 18 as the age of adulthood is linked to education. In many western countries, compulsory education typically ends around age 18, marking the point when young people often transition from full-time education to either further education, employment, or other pursuits. This transition is frequently viewed as a marker of increased autonomy and responsibility, which aligns with the idea of adulthood. Another reason is military service. In the past, conscription for military service played a significant role in determining the age of adulthood. For example, during world war I and ii, many countries drafted young men aged 18 or older for service, associating the age of 18 with maturity and responsibility. Historically, the legal age of adulthood varied depending on different factors such as gender, civil rights, property ownership, and rights to vote. In some cases, the age of maturity was set at 21, but the push to lower the voting age during the vietnam war in the United states eventually led to a more widespread adoption of 18 as the age of adulthood. Lastly, biological factors also play a role, as the late teens are typically when individuals complete the majority of their physical and cognitive development, signifying a transition to adulthood. In summary, the adoption of 18 as the age of adulthood is a result of various historical, social, cultural, and biological factors, mainly in western societies, but it's not a universally recognized standard across all cultures.	"Historically there were different ages for different things. Age of mariage was usually around 12-14 if there was one, age of vote was usually around 21-25 if people could vote, etc. 18 was common for the age men could be drafted to fight for a war. It became the main age of rights because people would say that if someone can be forced to fight for its country, they should have the right to ""something"", the something being vote, alcohol, smoking, etc. Then people started seeing 18 as the normal age for everything and some countries and states started postponing some rights till 18 too. 18 is still not the absolute age of rights. Age of consent is still mostly in the 14-16 range with extreme values from 12 to 18 for example. In the US, age of legal drugs is typically 21. Age of diving is often 16. Though there are people who believe 18 should be the age for everything and push for laws to be changed. It seems many people feel the need to have only one age used for laws. 18 was historically the age to be drafted (and still is where there is a draft) because it's typically the age at which a man stop getting taller and started getting more muscular, which was very important historically for war since combat was physically very intensive. Historically, men 18-25 were considered to be the fittest so they were typically the ones to be drafted."

The wiki article states it was initially spread through trade, and islam is now the second largest religion in India. But how? How does trade influence the spread of religion? Did these early traders talk about religion and the Indian traders like it better than theirs? Or did they get deals with islamic traders?	"It's a lot like what you assume. As trade crosses borders, so too does culture - including religion. Back in the time when this was happening, people had to manually transport their wares to other places and have relationships with their trading partners. Also, the arabic world was very powerful for a long time (until the mongols came about and set them back. ) a major catalyst of the crusades was more about a power struggle similar to the US/USSR and rome/carthage. Religion played a major role, granted. But it was more about those religions power than ""reclaiming the holy land for christ/allah. "" having that kind of influence means it's easier to spread your culture's dominant faith, thus increasing the origin power's influence. Think of the catholic church and how much it dominated European politics around the same time. The muslim world also sought to expand it's influence on it's neighbors, and trade works as well as conquest."	Religion often spreads through trade as people from different cultures interact and exchange ideas. When traders from different regions come together, they not only exchange goods but also share their customs, beliefs, and religions. In the case of islam in India, arab traders would travel to India for spices and other goods, and during their discussions, they might have shared their religious beliefs with local Indian traders. As trade relationships strengthen, so does the exchange of cultural and religious ideas. This sharing of ideas can lead to some people finding a new religion appealing, potentially leading them to adopt it. Additionally, religion can play a role in solidifying trade partnerships if both sides share common beliefs, creating a sense of trust and reliability. In India, islam may have spread as people found its teachings resonated with them. Over time, a mix of economic partnerships, shared beliefs, and personal connections led to more people adopting islam, making it the second-largest religion in the country today.

Over time, ancient ruins get buried underground due to a combination of natural events and human activities. Natural processes, like soil erosion, flooding, and plant growth, can deposit sediment on ruins, gradually burying them. Additionally, human activities, such as the construction of new buildings or roads, can also contribute to burying ruins. As layers of earth accumulate on top of these structures, they become submerged and hidden from view, waiting for archaeologists to discover and excavate them.	Nature continues to grow and die around and eventually over the ruins, but in city's and built up areas the ruins would have been known but just built over, same way now if you knew there was old bricks from a 1950s house on your land, you might just build on top as of it as it has no value now, same as an ancient building had no value a few years after it was build and abandoned.

Especially for the first generation who started to use money.	Our ancestors determined the worth of an item through the bartering system, where they exchanged goods or services based on perceived values. Each individual would assess the value of their own items and negotiate a fair trade with others. When money was first introduced, initial values of coins or currency were often tied to the value of specific scarce resources, like gold or silver, establishing a standardized unit of measure for worth, making trade and commerce more efficient.	Same way we know the value now. They made it up. Eventually prices kind of stabilize as there is a price that people are unwilling to pay, and a price people are unwilling to sell for. Generally its a relatively simple equation of time to earn money. 'this item is worth 4 hrs of my time and I warn . 25 of a dollar per hr, so ill pay 1 dollar for it'

The translation is relevant because it shows how jews adapted to a hellenistic society and provides insights into early biblical interpretations, influencing later christian biblical translations like the old testament.	Those are greek translations of the oldest parts of the old testament, or the sacred text of jews. According to the legend, pharaoh of Egypt asked his scholars to translate bible to his language (since last egyptian pharaoh dynasty was of greek origin).

The americas were isolated by vast oceans, making it difficult for Europeans and asians to reach them. At the time, navigation technology and shipbuilding were not advanced enough to handle long ocean voyages. Explorers also lacked knowledge about winds and currents, which made crossing the atlantic or pacific oceans challenging. Therefore, it took longer for the americas to be discovered by these nations.	"In reality, asians discovered the America's during the ice age. They migrated over from modern day Russia when the oceans were lower and a land bridge was formed.

"The celts, britons, picts, and anglo-saxons are different historical groups that played significant roles in the shaping of british history. They represent diverse cultures and peoples that inhabited the british isles at various points in time. The celts: the celts were a group of tribes that spread across Europe, reaching the british isles around 500 bce. They shared a common culture and spoke related languages, but were not a single unified people. They are famous for their art, metalwork, and warrior culture. Today, the celtic legacy can still be seen in regions like wales, scotland, and Ireland. The britons: the britons were a celtic people who lived in britain during the iron age and into the early roman period. They spoke the brittonic language, a celtic language that evolved into modern-day welsh, cornish, and breton. The term ""britons"" refers to the celtic inhabitants of britain who were not picts or scots (another celtic group in scotland). The picts: the picts were another celtic people living in what is now scotland during the late iron age and early medieval period. They are known for their distinctive carved stones, featuring detailed symbols and intricate patterns. The picts merged with the scots in the 9th century to form the kingdom of alba, which later became scotland. The anglo-saxons: the anglo-saxons were a group of germanic tribes, mainly the angles, saxons, and jutes, who migrated to britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. They eventually established several kingdoms in england, gradually pushing the britons further west. Their language, old english, formed the basis for modern english, and much of their culture, law, and social structures"	**celt** is a very very general term for all of the peoples west of Germany in antiquity, and this included countless different tribes and groups that all shared a very general language, religion, and culture ranging from Spain to Ireland. The word celt itself comes from greek and the origin of this term is not super clear. **britons** is the term often used to talk about the celts that lived specifically in great britain -- namely england and wales. **picts** were a celtic tribe in what is now scotland. The picts were around in roman times and eventually had a fairly sizable kingdom in scotland in the early middle ages. After the romans invaded britain and set up colonies, you had a long period where the local celts (mostly in england) mixed with the roman settlers and created what are called romano-british. After the roman empire abandoned the island, the local romano-british and celts soon found themselves at war with a bunch of invading German tribes, mostly from modern day Netherlands, northern Germany, and Denmark. The two main tribes that invaded england were the angles and the saxons, and that's where the term **anglo-saxon** comes from. England and english come from angles-land and angles-ish. The invading Germans eventually conquered the romano-british territory and fought wars against the remaining celts for centuries. This combination of celts, romano-british, and Germans form the basis of the (white) population of great britain.

After some brief research, it appears the most common consensus is; “primitive monkeys floated across the ocean on naturally constructed rafts made of vegetation and earth”.	"No other hominid primates have ever migrated to north or south America; not neanderthal, not homo erectus, only homo sapiens. ""new world"" primates are only distantly related to humans, unlike chimps and the other great apes which share a common ancestor with us about 5 million years ago."	Early primates likely crossed oceans via natural rafts formed from vegetation, like tangled logs and plants. They didn't create these rafts intentionally. The voyage was accidental and rare, but provided enough chances for some primates to reach new continents. While concrete evidence is scarce, fossil records support this migration theory.
525	5caf3cd1-8382-4811-9f3d-327baf2a7af5.txt	How did we understand the ancient egyptian language? Was the rosetta stone really enough?	The understanding of the ancient egyptian language was made possible through the discovery of the rosetta stone, which acted as a crucial key in deciphering hieroglyphs. The rosetta stone is a slab of black basalt inscribed with the same text in three scripts: greek, egyptian hieroglyphs, and egyptian demotic. The greek language was well-known by scholars, so by comparing the greek text with the other two scripts, they could identify similar meanings. A french scholar named jean-francois champollion played a significant role in the deciphering process. He had a profound knowledge of coptic, the last phase of the ancient egyptian language, which helped him link sounds to hieroglyphs. By studying the texts on the rosetta stone and using known ancient languages as a reference, scholars were able to gradually decipher the hieroglyphs, and subsequently, the ancient egyptian language. It wasn't just the rosetta stone itself, but the collaboration of numerous scholars and their vast knowledge of ancient languages that allowed us to understand more about ancient egyptian culture, history, and beliefs.	No, the rosetta stone alone was not enough, although it was a major breakthrough. There were other clues used to reconstruct egyptian. For one thing, there were other texts in multiple languages like the rosetta stone that were eventually discovered. Another important clue were names: because the hellenistic rulers of late Egypt (like ptolemy or cleopatra) used both cartouches written in hieroglyphs and their names in greek, the phonology of the heiroglyphs used in their era could be worked out based on the known pronounciation of their names in greek, which provided clues as to earlier phonology of those same heiroglyphs. Another major aspect of reconstructing the language was the understanding in the 19th century of how various languages evolved from others, and that modern-day coptic and semitic languages (like arabic) were related to egyptian. Languages evolve in predictable ways, so you can use modern-day forms to make some assumptions about more ancient forms if you know how they are related.

Archaeologists decipher ancient texts by using a combination of clues, context, and comparison to known languages or scripts. The process begins with identifying patterns, such as repeating symbols, phrases, or structures, which suggest a form of language or writing system. One effective method is to find a bilingual inscription, like the rosetta stone. The rosetta stone, discovered in 1799, contained a decree written in three scripts: ancient greek, egyptian hieroglyphics, and demotic script. Because scholars already knew ancient greek, they used it as a key to understand the other two scripts. This breakthrough allowed them to decipher egyptian hieroglyphics accurately. Another method is to analyze the context in which the text is found. Cultural and historical context can provide valuable information about the people who used the language. For example, if an inscription is found on a tomb or monument, it might indicate that the text is related to funerary rites or commemorating an important figure. This can help archaeologists narrow down possible meanings and establish the purpose of the text. Finally, linguists and experts in the field compare the unknown script with known languages or writing systems. By identifying similarities or shared elements, scholars can make educated guesses about the structure, grammar, and vocabulary of the unknown language. Through a combination of these techniques, archaeologists can decipher ancient texts and help bring the past to	If archaeologists discovered an ancient text that they truly knew nothing about, that might be nearly impossible. But usually scientists know at least something about what they've discovered. Languages change over time. So, while the old english language from 1,500 years ago looks very weird, we can get a lot of clues about it from looking at middle english from about 1,000 years ago, and from early modern english from 500 years ago. Each of those languages gets closer and closer to the modern english we use today. Occasionally, scientists will get lucky and discover something that makes understanding ancient texts much easier. The rosetta stone is the best example of this. It was a big stone monument that had the exact same text carved in it three times, in three different languages. The top and middle texts are in ancient egyptian using hieroglyphic and demotic scripts respectively, while the bottom is in ancient greek. This was huge. Scientists already had ancient greek figured out, and the rosetta stone helped them see how those ancient greek letters and words were translated into those egyptian languages.

Moreover, why wasn't the United States blackballed on a global scale for segregation the way South Africa was for apartheid?	The main difference between South African apartheid and American segregation is that apartheid was enforced by the national government through strict laws, while segregation in the US was mainly implemented through regional and local policies. Apartheid involved a system of racial classification where people were legally classified and divided into racial groups, with whites having the most rights and privileges. American segregation was mostly about racial separation in public spaces, like schools and transportation, and while unjust, it didn't involve such a deep institutional structure as in South Africa. As for the global reactions, the US wasn't blackballed because segregation was not as extensive and well-organized as apartheid, and international awareness of these issues was lower during the time when US segregation was being dismantled. Additionally, the US was a global superpower during the civil rights movement, which may have discouraged some countries from openly condemning its practices. South Africa, on the other hand, experienced apartheid during a time when international human rights standards had evolved, and the global community was more inclined to intervene in such blatant discrimination.	"Something that is important to understand in this context is that the US is about 75% white while South africa is about 20% white. This means that enforcing white ethnic power in South Africa was going to be far more challenging. The solution that was found was that certain areas were to be declared ""black homelands"". These areas were supposed to be made independent (though South Africa never allowed them real independence) and black people were to be citizens of these ""black homelands"" and not of South Africa, leaving South africa a white state. As such black people were not citizens of South Africa and were not legally able to live outside of these ""homelands"" (although those restrictions were more in paper than in reality). To summarize: South Africa had a black majority while the US had a white one. As such enforcing white power in South Africa required much more extreme measures."

Goddess athena is a prominent figure in greek mythology known as the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts. She is important in greek history because she represents the virtues of knowledge, courage, and strategic thinking. Athena is often depicted with an owl, which symbolizes wisdom. In ancient Greece, athens, the capital city, was named after her as she was considered the city's protector. Athena's significance highlights the importance of intellect and strategic abilities in greek culture.	Athena is the goddess of wisdom knowledge, strategy, legality, and weaving. She is the daughter of zeus and a member of the olympians. She was heavily prayed to in order to gain her favor and assistance for many reasons, especially during times of war, when planning was needed. This is why she is often referred to as a war goddess. She was to said to have invented the olive tree

"Napoleon is considered one of the greatest military geniuses of all time because of his innovative strategies, tactical prowess, and ability to inspire his soldiers. Despite ultimately losing the war, he achieved numerous victories and expanded France's territory during his reign. Think of Napoleon as a chess player: he was able to make moves that outsmarted his opponents, even those with larger armies. With his skill for quick decision-making and talent for improvisation, he consistently caught enemies off-guard, leading to many victories. Napoleon revolutionized warfare with his use of the ""corps"" system, which divided armies into smaller units for flexibility and efficiency. Furthermore, Napoleon was a charismatic leader, motivating his troops with a strong sense of nationalism and purpose. This inspired loyalty and dedication and contributed to his success on the battlefield. While he ultimately lost the war, his impact on military tactics and strategy continues to be studied and admired."	Yes, he lost in the end, but it took *several* coalitions of all the other great powers in combination to make that happen. He was that era's master of the operational art. His army had a smaller baggage train than most (and was very disciplined), and he used that to move quickly (by forced marches if need be), to the right place, at the right time, thereby tying larger and less skillfully commanded armies in knots. Every general aims to do this, but it really is as much a talent as a skill. As he put it himself:>there are in Europe many good generals, but they see too many things at once. I see one thing, namely the enemy's main body. I try to crush it, confident that secondary matters will then settle themselves.

I am trying to comprehend how something that required methodical steps and ‘good luck’ came to be a staple of civilisations for thousands of years. Thank you.	The process of making bread from wheat evolved gradually over time. Ancient humans first started by eating wild grains for nourishment. They then discovered that crushing these grains (milling) made them easier to eat and digest. When mixed with water, they formed a paste that could be cooked on hot stones, creating a basic flatbread. Over time, they learned to cultivate and selectively breed wheat, allowing them to grow taller and produce more grains. Yeast, which occurs naturally in the environment, was introduced to the dough, making it rise and creating the fluffy bread we know today. This bread-making process was refined over generations, becoming a staple food source for various civilizations.	While I don't know about this particular development, a lot of developments in technology are incremental. This particular discovery makes some degree of sense. Eating plants is a pretty old human tradition. Crushing them up to make a denser and more palatable food is a logical step forward. Mixing this with water and drying it follows - you can turn a powder into a solid wafer this way. We'd been doing this with many powders for a long time. Cooking it would make some sense, too. We fired clay and dried substances by fire. Why not do that with our food wafers? Especially since we were already cooking some foods like meat.

"Hitler and the Nazi party, who ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, harbored a hatred for the jewish people that was rooted in a combination of anti-semitic ideas and nationalist ideology. The Nazis believed that the jewish people were inferior to the so-called ""aryan"" race and saw them as a threat to the purity of German society. Hitler and the Nazis also blamed the jewish people for Germany's loss in world war I and for its economic problems during the 1930s. This hatred ultimately led to the genocide of six million jews during the holocaust."	Hitler and the Nazis believed in a concept called racial purity, which meant that they thought some races were superior to others. They saw the so-called aryan race as the purest and most superior. Hitler blamed the jewish people for many of Germany's problems, including their defeat in world war I and the economic issues that followed. This scapegoating was made easier by existing anti-semitic beliefs in Europe. By targeting the jewish people, hitler was able to rally support for his cause, resulting in the holocaust and the devastating loss of over six million jewish lives.

To me it seems like this would be similar to trying to learn to read Chinese with absolutely no access to any educational materials/teachers.	Philologists decipher ancient texts by comparing them to known languages, recognizing patterns, and using the context of the text. They often rely on texts containing multiple languages, like the rosetta stone, which had the same text in greek, egyptian hieroglyphics, and demotic (an egyptian script). By comparing the known language (greek) with the unknown languages, scholars could deduce how symbols and words corresponded. Additionally, understanding the historical and cultural context of the text helps philologists make educated guesses about certain words or symbols. Like solving a puzzle, they piece together clues from different fields to form a meaningful picture of the ancient language.	Two ways: 1 finding cases where it's translated into another language, that's why the rosetta stone was such a big deal, it had several languages all saying the same thing on it, one of which was ancient greek, which we already knew so they could use that translation to work backwards. The other way, is what another commenter said, you look at where words pop up, if you keep seeing a word show up on things at greengrocers and farms, it's probably a plant of some kind. And once you know a few words it starts to become possible to work out the others through context.

Well-preserved prehistoric animals are found in permafrost due to sudden temperature drops and rapid burial in the past. When the climate changed abruptly, the ground froze, trapping any deceased animals in the soil. This caused their bodies to freeze quickly before they had a chance to rot. Since permafrost is ground that remains consistently frozen for at least two consecutive years, the animals remained frozen and didn't thaw out in the same location. This natural deep freeze created a unique environment that preserved the animals' tissues, making them valuable resources for scientists to study today.	They’re specifically animals from the last ice age, when much of the far northern hemisphere was covered in glaciers. These animals migrated north in the summer to graze the bits of exposed tundra, and then likely headed back south before winter made the land completely inhospitable again. If an individual died in the fall when it had already dropped below freezing again, it would remain below freezing for the duration of a long and dark northern ice age winter. That gives the corpse many months to get buried in snow that eventually gets compacted into a glacier.

Salt was precious in ancient times because the process of obtaining it was labor-intensive, and not everyone had access to seawater. Boiling seawater to extract salt required a lot of fuel and time. Also, salt's ability to preserve food made it critical, increasing its value.	Because people don't all live within easy reach of the sea, and we need a lot of salt, both for eating and preserving food. And not every area has a lot of wood to fuel the fires needed, nor a lot of sunny days to use solar evaporation.

I read a few articles where some of these civilizations main focus was keeping warm because they were located so far north. So why would they not migrate more south?	The main reason why civilizations such as the pre dorset, thule, and inuit did not migrate south despite their harsh and extreme environments can be attributed to adaptation and the availability of resources in the arctic region. Over time, these civilizations became well-adapted to their cold environments, developing techniques and tools to survive the harsh conditions. For example, they built efficient, insulated homes—such as igloos—made from materials found in the arctic, like snow and ice. Their clothing, which was made from animal skins, provided excellent insulation as well. Moreover, the arctic region offered a unique set of resources that allowed these civilizations to thrive. These included whales, seals, walruses, and fish, which were abundant in the region. Hunting these animals not only provided food but also materials for clothing, tools, and shelter. This is similar to how some desert-dwelling civilizations were able to sustain themselves, despite their seemingly inhospitable environment. It's also important to note that the concept of moving towards a more favorable climate isn't always advantageous in practice. Migrating a whole civilization requires a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources. In addition, moving south could lead to competition with other groups for food and territory, increasing the likelihood of conflicts. In summary, while the arctic environments these civilizations inhabited were harsh, their adaptations and access to unique resources allowed them to live successfully in those areas. The potential drawbacks of migration, such as resource depletion and conflict, may have made staying in the arctic more viable.	"It's a matter of specialization. In nature, there's a concept called ""niche partitioning"". If two species are competing for the same resources (food, living space, etc). There are ultimately 2 outcomes:1) one of the creatures gets progressively better than the other, outcompeting them to extinction. 2) both creatures specialise into different areas, allowing them to live without having to compete against eachother as much, if at all. A similar situation can be seen in cultures. War between different groups was common in the americas, even before European settlement, and understandably so. If you're a hunter-gatherer society, and your population is growing, you are going to need more land to hunt in, and you hunting there means others can't. (this is a concept known as scarcity)since humans are always the most dangerous predator around, and niceties are only afforded when survival isn't an issue, other people are always a significant problem. Cultures like the inuit survived because they understood this, and decided that they'd learn to follow the food, wherever it may be. There was a choice: either fight others to maintain hunting territory, or go somewhere that no one wanted to hunt in. They chose the latter, and went further north. They learned how to survive up there when others didn't care to try, and they were lucky enough to succeed."

"The term ""caucasian"" originated from the work of anthropologist johann friedrich blumenbach in the 18th century. He divided humans into five racial categories, including caucasians, based on skull measurements. He believed that the caucasian race's origins traced back to the caucasus mountains between Europe and asia. However, today, the term is used more broadly to describe people of European, north african, and west asian descent, not just those from the caucasus region. Contemporary usage doesn't accurately reflect its historical origin but has evolved over time."	It's based on now disproven theory of human races. In the eighteenth century, the prevalent view among European scholars was that the human species had its origin in the region of the caucasus mountains. This view was based upon the caucasus being the location for the purported landing point of noah's ark – from whom the bible states that humanity is descended – and the location for the suffering of prometheus, who in hesiod's myth had crafted humankind from clay.

I know that they fell and probably lost wars, but why did no one reconstruct the ancient temples, buildings, and homes?	Ancient cities like those in ancient Greece are in ruins mainly because of natural factors, human interference, and the passage of time. These factors contribute to the gradual wear and tear of buildings and structures, leading to their current state of ruin. 1. Natural factors: over the centuries, various natural phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, erosion, and weathering can cause significant damage to buildings and structures. For example, in ancient Greece, many parts of the region were seismically active. Earthquakes could cause significant damage to the foundations and the main structures of buildings, eventually leading to their collapse. 2. Human interference: throughout history, many ancient cities were invaded or conquered by different civilizations, which often resulted in the destruction of buildings and other infrastructure. Additionally, many ancient structures were demolished or repurposed by later generations for their own use. For example, some buildings were dismantled to reuse stones and other materials to construct new structures. Others were converted into other types of buildings or were intentionally destroyed for religious or political reasons. 3. Passage of time: naturally, all buildings have a certain lifespan. As time passes, building materials such as wood, stone, and metal can gradually deteriorate, leading to the weakening and eventual collapse of structures. Ancient buildings were generally not built with the same lasting materials or modern construction techniques that current buildings use, so they are more susceptible to decay over time. 4. Lack of maintenance and reconstruction: in many cases, once a city or civilization declined, there was often no available resources or interest in maintaining or reconstructing the buildings. This is partly due to the fact that the people who once inhabited these cities no longer lived there or their descendants had no connection with the ancient structures. Over time, without proper care, the buildings would fall into disrepair and eventually become ruins. To summarize, ancient cities like ancient Greece are in ruins due to a combination of natural factors, human interference, and the passage of time. Many factors contribute to the gradual deterioration of these structures, making it difficult to maintain or reconstruct them over the centuries.	Imagine that a skyscraper in new york city collapsed tomorrow. Now imagine all of the work, materials, and coordination it would take to rebuild it. You'd need... * enough labor to clear the rubble, bring new materials in, and then actually reconstruct the building. * people with training/specializations -- architects, demolition experts, project managers, foremen, contractors, etc. . . * a coherent and organized government to ensure a safe rebuilding effort for the years it would take to rebuild the building. * the infrastructure to remove the debris and then bring new materials in, some of which are going to need to come from large distances away. * and, of course, enough money to pay all of these people and materials, as well as a nearby place to safely house all the workers. Without any one of these, it becomes very difficult to rebuild the skyscraper -- or, at the very least, you're not likely to build something that is high quality. If the state of new york was in the midst of a civil war or a massive earthquake, the odds that they have the time or resources to dedicate to rebuilding that skyscraper is pretty low. A large temple in ancient Greece was akin to a skyscraper -- it was a massive undertaking that took a ton of time, resources, coordination, and wealth. It took the city of athens 10 years to build the parthenon -- and that was while they were at the peak of their wealth and influence. Plenty of these buildings did get rebuilt or recovered over time when they fell apart... But it was far from a simple undertaking and needed a lot of things to be going right or the building was simply going to be left to ruin... Or it was going to be cannibalized for other building projects.

According to [this graph](https://flic.kr/p/5t5hke) I found by accident, the world population barely increased at all between 1300 and 1900. And then it suddenly took off like crazy. What caused this sudden fast increment of the world population?	The drastic increase in world population after 1900 can be attributed to a combination of factors that led to lower death rates and longer life expectancies. These factors include advancements in medicine, improved agriculture, and better sanitation, among others. Firstly, medical advancements played a crucial role in population growth, as they led to a decrease in death rates from infectious diseases. Examples include the discovery of antibiotics and the development of vaccines that helped combat deadly illnesses such as smallpox, polio, and measles. Secondly, improved agricultural practices and technologies enabled higher crop yields, leading to more abundant and reliable food supplies. As a result, fewer people suffered from malnutrition and related illnesses, further contributing to lower death rates and longer life expectancies. Lastly, better sanitation and access to clean water positively impacted public health, reducing the spread of waterborne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery. In summary, the world population increased rapidly after 1900 due to advancements in medicine, improved agriculture, and better sanitation, which collectively contributed to lower death rates and longer life expectancies.	Three factors contributed the most, but by no means are the only 3 factors. First one being a better understanding of medicine and disease, including the introduction of vaccines. People died less often from preventable disease, especially children, meaning more people made it to adulthood to themselves also breed. Fewer babies dying means both more adults,and more breeders. Second, mechanical farming and chemical farming - that is, artificial fertilizer. Between better fertilizer which improved crop yields, and farm equipment which allowed more to be harvested in less time meaning there was more food for even the new larger population. And third was a combination of the internal combustion engine and the plane. With transportation that made land, air, and sea travel much much faster, it was suddenly much easier to transport all of this food to where the people are. Obviously it's a lot more complicated and this is a really simple explanation

"The afghan civil war refers to a continuous state of conflict in Afghanistan that began in 1978 and has involved various phases and factions. The main factors that led to the rise of the taliban and the role of the Soviet union can be summarized as follows:throughout the 1970s, Afghanistan experienced political instability, which created an environment for conflict. In 1978, a socialist government, backed by the Soviet union, took control of the country. This new government faced opposition from afghan citizens who resented the communist policies, leading to the rise of various armed rebel groups called ""mujahideen. ""in response to this opposition, the Soviet union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to support the communist government. This sparked a long and brutal war, with the mujahideen receiving financial and military support from the United states and other countries who opposed the Soviet presence. During the 1980s, Afghanistan became a battleground for cold war politics, with the Soviet union and the United states supporting opposing sides. The Soviet union eventually withdrew its troops in 1989, but the civil war continued as the mujahideen fought to gain control of the country. In this power vacuum, a new group called the taliban emerged. The taliban was a radical islamist movement, consisting mostly of former mujahideen fighters who wanted to establish a strict islamic government. By 1996, the taliban managed to seize control of most of Afghanistan, establishing their hardline regime. The Soviet union played a significant role in Afghanistan's recent history, as their support of the communist government and subsequent invasion directly contributed"	Complex topic… but in short the Soviet Union wanted communism to rise against the islamic people who were rising faster in Afghanistan at the time. These islamic fighters were called mujahideen. It started as mujahideen versus islamic guerillas. Mujahideen kept winning, so the Soviet Union invaded. US (and others) backed the mujahideen further in an attempt to hurt the Soviet Union indirectly, known as a proxy war. This was a way the US and Soviet Union could ‘fight’ without actually fighting directly during the cold war. Fast forward to the end of the 80s, mujahideen were successful, Soviet troops withdrew, and a small contingent of the mujahideen took over control. They were known as the taliban, and rose to power really really fast. They dominated for years, until the US came into Afghanistan and took control themselves in 2001. US hung around trying to do to the same as the Soviet Union; attempting to implement their own government structure (this time, democracy). Fast forward to 2021, US withdraws (same as the Soviet Union) and the taliban re-take control. A really good book if you want the non-eli5 version is directorate s; in short, the book dives into how the US and Pakistan ‘enabled’ the rise of taliban from its humble beginnings within the mujahideen.

This event led to a tangled web of alliances, rivalries, and competing interests among European countries. Nationalism, militarism, and imperialism added fuel to the fire, culminating in a devastating global conflict. Ww2 was primarily sparked by the unresolved issues of WW1 and the rise of dictatorships, mainly in Germany, Italy, and Japan.

The main reason behind the US being unable to eradicate the taliban, despite its military strength, lies in the complexities of the region, the nature of guerilla warfare, and challenges with nation-building efforts. To begin with, the taliban operates within a complex geographic and social landscape. Afghanistan has a diverse and fragmented tribal society, which makes it challenging for an external force to navigate and exert full control. This fragmentation can also lead to various factions within Afghanistan providing support and shelter to the taliban. Additionally, Afghanistan's mountainous terrain and porous borders with Pakistan offer the taliban ample opportunities to hide and regroup, further complicating the task for the US military. Secondly, the taliban employs guerilla warfare tactics, which works to their advantage against a conventional military force like the US. Guerilla warfare relies on small, fast-moving groups that blend in with the local population and use hit-and-run tactics against their opponents. This allows the taliban to avoid direct engagements with US forces and effectively strike targets, making it extremely difficult for the US military to identify and engage with the enemy. A helpful analogy here is trying to swat a swarm of mosquitoes with a tennis racket- though the racket might be more powerful, it is ineffective due to the elusive nature of the mosquitoes. Lastly, nation-building and establishing a stable government in Afghanistan proved to be a significant challenge for the US. After toppling the taliban regime in the early 2000s, the US attempted to create a democratic government. However, this new government struggled with corruption, inefficiencies, and a reliance on foreign aid. As a result, many afghan citizens became disillusioned with the government, which allowed the taliban to capitalize on the situation, regaining influence and control in various regions. In conclusion, the US's inability to eradicate the taliban stems from the complex and fragmented nature of Afghanistan, the difficulties of fighting an elusive enemy that employs guerilla warfare tactics, and challenges with nation-building efforts that allowed the taliban to regain influence.	A variety of reasons. A big one is because it's hard to destroy and enemy who doesn't stand there and fight you. It's like trying to crush a a rabbit with a tank. The rabbit doesn't stand a chance if it stays there, but that's why it doesn't the other is that for geopolitical reasons the US restrained a large part of its use of force. A huge part this which most people don't understand is that the taliban really wasn't the enemy and they weren't unconnected to the local politics. In Afghanistan the US was *supposed* to be there for strictly advisory and organizational purposes. Turns out a lack of will for the local Afghanistan populace to fight the taliban, corruption, differences in social standards and ethics, arrogance on the part of the afghan military, and being a generally poor fighting force all made it essentially impossible for the US to beat the taliban because the US wasn't fighting them, they were fighting the impossibility of getting a weak and foreign government to run a country of people who are aligned with their tribes not the state. It was a task doomed to fail. The US has had success fighting other less complex battles, like essentially exterminating ISIS and ISIL. A large part of why that was possible was a lack of general restraint in pursuing the objective of total annihilation. Annihilation was never the goal with the taliban. Ideally, the objective would be to force them into a position where they would have to negotiate and would join the afghan state. Afghanistan collectively was larger than the taliban but by itself the taliban was the single largest and most influential tribe in Afghanistan

The United states' decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki instead of demonstrating their power through a non-combative display can be attributed to a combination of factors such as strategic considerations, urgency, and uncertainties about the bomb's effectiveness. To begin with, let's consider the strategic perspective. During world war ii, the United states and its allies sought to force Japan to surrender and end the war as quickly as possible. Demonstrating the destructive power of a nuclear bomb by detonating it in the ocean might not have been as persuasive or as immediate in securing Japan's surrender as directly targeting cities that were crucial to Japan's military and industrial infrastructure. Think of it this way: if you want to stop someone from doing something, causing direct harm may be more effective and immediate than simply demonstrating your ability to harm them. The decision-makers at the time believed that the swift and devastating bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would lead to Japan's surrender and save lives in the long run by preventing a drawn-out invasion of the Japanese mainland, which could have resulted in a much higher death toll for both sides. Another reason was the urgency of the situation. In the summer of 1945, the allies were preparing for a land invasion of Japan, which was expected to cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives. Delaying the use of the atomic bombs may have significantly prolonged the conflict and escalated the human cost. It's also important to remember that the Soviet Union was about to join the war against Japan, which added pressure on the US to act decisively and attempt to bring about a quick end to the war. Furthermore, at the time the bombs were dropped, there had been only two successful tests of nuclear weapons. Given the limited information available about the bomb's effectiveness, as well as the possibility that it might have failed or have been less destructive than anticipated, the United states chose to use the bomb for maximum impact. An unsuccessful demonstration, or one that was less impactful than the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, could have led Japan to believe that the US was bluffing, potentially prolonging the war. It is also crucial to note that communication channels between the US and Japan during wartime were limited and unreliable. Arranging a demonstration for Japan's leadership could have proven difficult logistically and might not have carried the desired effect, even if the bomb were shown to be as powerful in the demonstration as in the actual attacks. Lastly, the moral and ethical aspects of the bombings were not at the forefront of strategic thinking at the time. The concept of total war, in which civilian and military resources were considered legitimate targets, was prevalent during world war ii. In this context, the bombings were not seen as drastically different from other targeting strategies used throughout the war, such as the large-scale firebombing of Japanese cities prior to the use of the atomic bombs. In summary, the United states chose to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki rather than demonstrating their power at sea because they believed it would be a more effective and immediate means to force Japan's surrender, saving lives in the long run by preventing a protracted land invasion. Additionally, the urgency of the situation, uncertainties surrounding the bomb's effectiveness, and logistical and communication challenges made the direct use of the bombs a more viable option at the time.	1) the atomic bombs used in wwii were pretty small. The damage that they caused was more a factor of how Japanese buildings were constructed (tightly packed with wooden walls and brick roofs). Well built buildings, even those relatively close to ground zero, sustained little damage in the bombings. The bombs wouldn't have been particularly impressive if detonated outside of a Japanese city. Modern nuclear bombs are thousands of times the size of the wwii bombs. 2) the US had run out of conventional bombs and couldn't replenish stocks quickly enough to do more than a handful of raids each year. The Japanese government was aware of this. The cities targeted for atomic bombing were cities that the US wanted to destroy by firebombing - they just couldn't because they didn't have the bombs to do so. Another effect of this is that the Japanese weren't particularly concerned about surrendering because they didn't believe the US had the ability to do meaningful damage to the mainland. This is also a key reason that they didn't surrender after the first bombing. The second bombing tricked the Japanese into thinking that the US could produce atomic bombs at a relatively quick rate *and that those bombs would continue to be used against Japan*. Detonating two bombs in the ocean may have convinced them that the US could produce bombs quickly, but would have also convinced them that the US was unwilling to actually use said bombs, which would have defeated the entire purpose of the show of force. Japan wasn't going to surrender until at least one, and most likely two cities were bombed. Japan and the US had been negotiating surrender for quite some time before the atomic bombings and Japanese negotiators had repeatedly communicated the Japanese government's unwillingness to surrender. 3) terror bombing was a common tactic that every country at the time used. The Japanese had been particularly prolific in using it against China prior to and after the US entry into the war. Part of what prompted the US to conduct a larger firebombing campaign against Japan than it did against Germany was that the US felt that it was necessary to punish Japan for its actions in China - where the Japanese deliberately killed tens of millions of people. Keep in mind, Japanese atrocities during wwii were widely documented while they were occurring. German atrocities were documented in two waves, both of which occurred post war. The holocaust was documented over a period of several years after the war ended. The Soviet Union made a lot of claims of eastern front atrocities, some of which were true and some weren't. In the broader context of claims that the Soviet Union made during the cold war, the west didn't believe most of what the Soviet Union was saying (for good reason). That changed in the 1990's, when Russia opened up some of the Soviet archives to western researchers, who could then go through and verify the Soviet claims.

The process of rebuilding a nation after a war is called nation-building. In the case of Germany and Japan after world war ii, the US and the west were primarily responsible for shaping their development, while the situations in Afghanistan and Iraq are more complex due to numerous factors. First, let's look at Germany and Japan. After world war ii, the US and its allies (known as the west) carried out a set of policies called the marshall plan to help rebuild war-torn countries in Europe, including Germany. The marshall plan provided financial aid, resources, and support to rebuild infrastructure, industry, and ultimately, the economy. This plan successfully established a foundation for economic growth and political stability. Similarly, in Japan, the US-led occupation implemented democratic reforms and provided support for industrial development, facilitating its rapid recovery and economic growth. Now, let's compare this to Afghanistan and Iraq. The initial invasions of these countries were mainly aimed at removing their existing governments (taliban in Afghanistan and saddam hussein in Iraq) rather than installing new, stable structures. The emphasis was more on immediate military intervention rather than long-term nation-building. Moreover, Afghanistan and Iraq faced significant challenges to building sustainable governance. Both countries have diverse populations with multiple ethnic and religious groups, making it hard to establish a unified government. In contrast, Germany and Japan have more homogeneous populations, which made it easier for the west to reimpose stable governance. Another factor that contributed to the challenges in Afghanistan and Iraq was the involvement of various regional actors with contrasting objectives. Countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia provided support to different factions in both nations, fueling further instability. Lastly, the lack of trust between local populations and foreign occupation forces was a significant issue in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Germany and Japan, the US and the west had clear goals: create stable democratic governments that would prevent future wars. This clarity of purpose led to a more focused and comprehensive rebuilding process. However, in Afghanistan and Iraq, the objectives of intervention were less clear-cut, leading to skepticism and mistrust among local populations. In summary, the success of nation-building in Germany and Japan can be attributed to focused financial aid, clear objectives, and favorable demographic conditions, whereas complex regional factors, ethnic divisions, and lack of trust led to less successful efforts	"For Japan, it's because the emperor ordered the Japanese people to cooperate with their occupiers, and most of the Japanese army leadership that would have been capable of forming an armed insurgency were either arrested or killed themselves. For Germany, an awful lot of it had to do with the fact that an overwhelming majority of the German people who *weren't* fighting (and a hell of a lot who were) had *no* idea about hitler's ""final solution"" and were just as horrified at the discovery of the concentration camps as the rest of the world. They knew that the Nazis had rounded up the jews, of course, but as far as most people knew the jews were working in factories somewhere, not been slaughtered wholesale. In either case, Japan and Germany had what Iraq and Afghanistan have *never* had: a national identity. The middle east is still a *very* tribal area, and even though the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan have existed for decades it wasn't the people who lived there that drew the borders. You have to understand the culture of the people in the middle east: they take care of themselves first, then they take care of their neighbors. It also doesn't help that the dominant religion in the area specifically orders them to lie to ""infidels,"" either. So what you end up with is a people with absolutely *zero* stake in their ""country"" not giving a good alah damn about what infidel outsiders think is best for said country, let alone for *them,* personally. That whole iraqi and afghan national army collapsing as quickly as they did against isis and the taliban after the coalition forces left? Anybody (under the rank of major, at least) who had spent any appreciable time with those forces knew that was *exactly* how things were going to go down."

Liberalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom, equal rights, and limited government intervention. Neo-liberalism, on the other hand, is an economic approach that promotes free-market capitalism, deregulation, and reduced government spending in social programs. While liberalism focuses on protecting individual liberties, neo-liberalism prioritizes creating a favorable economic environment for businesses to flourish and compete.	Someone else has given a good description of liberalism but neoliberalism is a bit more difficult to define as the term comes with a lot of connotations for different people. A better term for neoliberalism is the washington consensus which has largely guided politics since the 1980s. There are 3 points to the washington consensus: 1. Privatisation, 2. Deregulation, 3. Global markets.

550	e5fdef40-64fd-412c-839f-c657bbb5f146.txt	Why have people always “moved west”?	"People have historically ""moved west"" in search of new opportunities and resources. Expansion towards the west often meant access to vast, unclaimed lands with fertile soil for farming, natural resources, and potential spaces for settlements. For example, in the United states during the 1800s, westward expansion was encouraged through the concept of manifest destiny, which was the belief that it was America's destiny to expand and settle across the continent."	This is a bias from the days of colonization of north America. European settlers landed on the east cost of the americas because that was the closest to Europe. So as time went on and colonization continued they had to move west because that's the land that was available. By comparison australians colonized the coasts of aus because most of the interior of Australia is desert and very hard living.
551	f3dcace1-51f9-483b-8974-17a292bc2193.txt	What are the origins of halloween and what is halloween about?	"Halloween is a holiday with ancient origins and is celebrated on october 31st every year. It originated from the celtic festival of samhain (pronounced ""sah-win""), which marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the ""darker half"" of the year - winter. During samhain, the celts believed that the boundaries between the living world and the spirit world became thin, allowing spirits, both benign and malevolent, to freely cross over. They thought the presence of these spirits helped their priests to predict the future, which was crucial in their everyday lives. To celebrate the event, they would build large bonfires, wear costumes, and offer food to appease the visiting spirits. When the romans conquered celtic lands, they blended this tradition with their own festivals. This amalgamation included feralia, a day to honor the dead, and a day to celebrate pomona, the goddess of fruit and trees, symbolized by apples - the origin of the apple-bobbing game. As christianity spread, the church sought to replace these pagan celebrations with a christian holiday. In the 8th century, pope gregory iii declared november 1st as ""all saints' day"" to honor saints and martyrs. The evening before soon came to be known as ""all hallows' eve,"" which eventually evolved into modern-day halloween. Over time, halloween has transformed from a religious and cultural celebration to a more secular event involving trick-or-treating, costumes, and festive decorations."	Im no expert, but my understanding is that its an old celtic holiday called samhain (pronounced sow-in) in short, people believed the boundaries between the world of the living and the dead became weak enough to be breached and spirits could walk the same land as the living. A leading theory for where dressing up came from is that people wanted to be mistaken for spirits so the real spirits didn't bother them. Jack-o-lanterns (originally made from a turnip) were made to symbolise (or ward off) one particular spirit, called stingy jack. Again, the abridged version is that he led a sinful life and tricked the devil into promising to never take his soul so when he died, he was rejected from both heaven and hell, leaving him to wander the earth with a hollowed out turnip and a candle to light his way. When the christians arrived, this tradition was modernised, the day following was turned into a celebration of all saints and revered figures and the night of samhain (which actually use to be multiple nights) because all hallow's eve. Observations like cow sacrificing was ushered away, but others were kept. For the celts, samhain marked the end of the year, but obviously for us now, halloween is not

The political tensions between India and Pakistan mainly stem from historical, religious, and territorial disputes. When british India was divided in 1947, it created two new countries: predominantly hindu India and predominantly muslim Pakistan. This division, known as the partition, led to massive population migrations and violence, leaving a lasting impact on both nations. The major territorial dispute surrounds the region of kashmir, which both countries claim as their own. Since their independence, India and Pakistan have fought several wars and continue to face tense relations often escalating near the line of control in kashmir. Additionally, global politics and military rivalries contribute to the ongoing animosity between the two nations.	India and Pakistan used to be a single british colony called India. When british rule ended in 1947 the region split into India and Pakistan. India is predominantly hindu and Pakistan predominantly muslim. This split was not at all friendly, as tension between the two has gone on for centuries. After this split, there was a huge dispute over a large region on the India/Pakistan border that was mostly muslim but ruled by hindus. This eventually lead to some very violent wars. Hostility still exists between the two states, with both committing some pretty heinous acts. Oddly enough, they're still civil enough to play cricket against each other. Edit:... Well, mostly civil.

Benghazi refers to an attack in 2012, when a US Diplomatic compound in benghazi, Libya, was targeted by militants, killing four Americans, including the ambassador. There was an uproar because some blamed inadequate security measures and a slow government response in handling the situation. U.S. Political parties argued over the causes, with republicans accusing the then-president obama and secretary of state hillary clinton of being negligent, while democrats claimed it was a tragic event exploited for political gain. This led to multiple investigations and ongoing debates over responsibility and accountability.	People in the US embassy in benghazi Libya were murdered. When it happened, the information that was coming from the US government was changing during the hours following the event. There were many hearings by the republican congress which included the questioning of hillary clinton (she was US secretary of state at the time). All congressional panels (republicans) found that she committed no wrongdoing. But politicians found out that if they just keep bringing it up, their supporters who hate her, loved it and it helped to get more republican voters to the polls.

"Argentina became a popular destination for Nazis escaping post-world war ii prosecution primarily due to its neutral stance during the war, large German community, and the sympathies of its then president juan perón. This created an environment that was both welcoming and relatively safe for fleeing Nazis. The main way Nazis managed to escape to Argentina undetected was through an underground network of smugglers and sympathizers known as the ""ratlines. "" these routes began in Europe, often originating from Italy or Spain, and facilitated the escape of Nazis by providing them with fake documents, such as passports and visas, to aid in their travels. These countries were chosen because they were either fascist regimes or neutral territories, making it difficult for foreign authorities to successfully pursue escaped Nazis. To cross the atlantic ocean, the fleeing Nazis would board ships, either passenger or cargo, using their false identity papers. They would then sail towards south America, where they could blend in with the large German expatriate community, often receiving support and assistance from these individuals. In summary, Nazis escaped to Argentina due to its neutral stance during the war, a large German community, and president perón's sympathies. They managed to cross the atlantic undetected by utilizing smuggling networks and fake documents, then blending in with supportive expatriate communities upon arrival."	There were a lot of German emigrants in Russia (the volga Germans, named after the are where they settled), who had originally been invited there by the Russian empress catherine the great, who was of German descent. After her passing, the Russia government began to roll back many of the benefits/privileges that catherine had provided them, so they looked to leave Russia. At the time, a lot of south American countries were trying to attract immigrants from Europe to boost their population and settle the land. Argentina and Brazil attracted a lot of these German emigrants, as they both had officially installed roman catholicism as their state religion (the volga Germans were mainly catholics). So there was a large population of ethnic Germans in Argentina long before the world wars. This led to friendly relationships between Argentina and both imperial Germany and Nazi Germany. After the second world war, this made Argentina a prime destination for those who were associated with Nazi Germany and wanted to flee. With the destruction caused by the war, record-keeping was not great, so it was not very difficult for officials to travel under false identities/papers in order to escape detection.

While not exactly like the brexit movement, which mainly focused on leaving the European union, the national front did share some common goals, such as reducing immigration and preserving national sovereignty. One notable example of their activities was their involvement in street protests and violent confrontations with anti-racist groups.

The main reason no one died while tearing down the Berlin wall, despite the presence of landmines, is due to the careful and controlled manner in which the wall was dismantled and the prior removal of mines by authorities. To understand this process, let's first take a step back to briefly explain the Berlin wall. The Berlin wall was a fortified barrier that divided east and west Berlin from 1961 to 1989. It was constructed by east Germany (the German democratic republic or gdr) to prevent east Germans from escaping to west Germany (the federal republic of Germany or frg). The wall was heavily guarded and defended by various means, including landmines, which were intended to deter potential defectors from trying to cross the border. When the border between east and west Germany was opened on november 9, 1989, it was a relatively organized event, with the east German government announcing the decision to allow citizens to travel freely between the two countries. The actual demolition of the wall began later, in the following days and weeks. At this point, east and west German authorities, as well as military and border patrol units from both sides, began to collaborate in removing the existing border defenses, including the mines. Before any part of the wall was dismantled, the authorities were responsible for surveying the area and ensuring that all landmines and other hazards had been removed. This process was carried out carefully and systematically to ensure the safety of the public and workers involved in the demolition. Once an area was deemed safe, sections of the wall were removed piece by piece, often with the help of heavy machinery such as cranes and bulldozers. During the entire dismantling process, extensive precautions were taken, and as a result, no one died due to landmines while tearing down the Berlin wall. The collaborative effort to ensure safety, along with the controlled environment in which the demolition took place, allowed for the peaceful and relatively safe removal of the wall, marking an important turning point in history.	The teardown of the Berlin wall was done in a far more controlled fashion then what some pictures made it look like. People were campaigning and marching in the streets for the government to open the checkpoints. And when they announced to the public that the checkpoints were open people marched to the checkpoints and expected the guards to let them through. After some confusion the guards opened the checkpoints and let people through. So nobody was even trying to get through the wall where the landmines were, why would they do that when the checkpoints were open? The wall was not actually demolished until later on. Parts of the wall is still standing. And even when the wall was torn down it was done in controlled fashion with police staning guard and contractors hired by the government to help bringing it down. This is why in the same photos where people are smashing the wall with sledgehammers and climbing over it there are excevators next to them pulling down sections of the wall. The areas with heavy barbed wires and landmines were obviously still guarded even after the wall fell. The signs informing people that they were approaching a minefield was still up, the barriers around these areas were still in place and guards were still patroling the area. There were no reason for people to venture into these areas either as there were plenty of other pieces of wall to smash that was not protected by landmines. The landmines were eventually removed by mine clearing teams that were following the maps of the mines. A lot of times the same people who mined the area would be retrieving the mines. This process did take some time, meanwhile these areas were closed off and people had to use the nearby checkpoints.

The satanic panic was a widespread social and moral panic in the 1980s, primarily in the United states, fueled by fears of a secret network of satanists engaging in ritual abuse, human sacrifice, and other criminal activities. This panic was perpetuated by sensationalist media coverage, a rise in occult-themed entertainment, and publicized cases of alleged child abuse with satanic elements. One contributing factor was the increased visibility of heavy metal music, occult-themed movies, and the role-playing game dungeons & dragons, which some individuals believed could lead to satanism and criminal behavior. Additionally, talk show hosts and news articles would give a platform to alleged survivors and experts, further spreading the fear. The panic gained traction as more people, including therapists, law enforcement, and religious figures, began to take the claims seriously, leading to numerous false allegations and wrongful convictions. Eventually, skepticism and a lack of concrete evidence debunked most of these claims, and the satanic panic subsided by the early 1990s.	"The satanic panic was a movement by certain evangelical folks primarily in the south and midwest that catered to religious individuals who were eager to believe that anything they thought was evil, or anything they couldn't control, was by definition ""satanic"". They started seeing it in music, in movies, in tv, in video games. Everything. It was an easy message to sell. Make people afraid of something and they'll give you money or vote for you. So thats what happened. They started seeing demons in everything, it became all consuming. Everything they didn’t understand or control became “satanic”. It was a natural consequence of the movement away from biblical literacy in the church and the growth of televangelists and political/religious power brokers. It died down a bit but it’s become very powerful again. The same people still tell the same folks that hollywood and movies are satanic, that gay people are satanic, etc etc etc. It sells."

Old military equipment is often not scrapped for several reasons, such as historical preservation, potential repurposing, and cost-effectiveness. First, some decommissioned tanks and airplanes are preserved as historical artifacts in museums or other collections. They serve as reminders of past wars and technological advances in military history. Second, old military equipment can be repurposed or upgraded for other uses, either within the military realm or for civilian applications. For example, older planes might be converted into aerial firefighting vehicles, while decommissioned armored vehicles could be used for disaster relief efforts. Lastly, scrapping and recycling military equipment can be costly and resource-intensive. The process of dismantling, melting, and reusing the materials involves a significant investment of time, labor, and money. Sometimes, it is more cost-effective to store old equipment in graveyards, where they remain available for potential future use or repurposing. Overall, the decision to scrap or store decommissioned military equipment depends on its historical value, ability to be repurposed, and the cost-effectiveness of recycling the materials.	There are two uses for that:1) verifiable decomissioning. Imagine you have a bunch of these cool planes and you sign a treaty saying you should stop using them. So what do you do? You chop off their wings (yes, this does sound painful, especially for _really cool_ planes) and leave them in a desert where you a satellite can see them. Https://goo.gl/maps/eoqvwh1dtqvfup857 shows a bunch of b-52s required to be there by salt. 2) really just storage for potential later use. Land in a desert is cheap and if you can revive all this hardware should you need to --- if things go very bad and you need them (notice Russia pulling t-62s out of storage) or if someone else could still use them (eg. The humvees sent to Ukraine). This is also done in civil aviation --- properly stored, planes can be put into use when there's demand for them or used for parts when needed.

The balkans is a region in southeast Europe with a complex history of diverse cultures, religions, and empires vying for power. Over time, different groups of people settled, creating various nations. The animosity mainly stems from the 20th century, when yugoslavia, a multi-ethnic country, was artificially formed. After the fall of communism, tensions between ethnic groups led to the violent balkan wars, resulting in the breakup of yugoslavia into smaller countries. This turbulent past left deep scars, leading to the multitude of nations and lingering hostilities.	There are many nations historically present on a relatively small piece of land, so some of them (e.g. Albania and Serbia) have conflicting claims, therefore hostility between some of these nations as well as nationalism are very hard to avoid. To make things even more complicated, balkans have been a battleground for austro-hungaria, ottoman empire, and other large nations for quite some time. There was an attempt to bring slavic people of balkans into a single country (yugoslavia), but it was eventually torn apart by internal and external forces.

"The battle of castle itter was a unique event during world war ii, where German soldiers joined forces with the allies to defend a medieval prison-castle called castle itter in Austria. The German soldiers fought alongside the allies in this battle due to a shared objective of protecting high-profile prisoners and the unstable situation in Germany towards the end of the war. Before we dive into the details, let's first understand the background. Castle itter, located in austrian tyrol, was used by the Nazi regime as a prison for high-ranking french politicians, military personnel, and other prominent individuals who were against Nazi Germany. Some of the prisoners included former prime ministers, notable generals, and sports icons. As world war ii was coming to a close in may 1945, the Nazi regime was collapsing, and chaos ensued within its ranks. The main events of the battle unfolded as follows:1. On may 4, 1945, the prison's guards fled the castle, fearing the approaching allied forces. Seeing an opportunity, zvonimir čučković, an imprisoned yugoslav communist, sought help from the nearby American 103rd infantry division. 2. A small rescue mission, led by American captain john lee and consisting of an m4 sherman tank named ""besotten jenny,"" along with a dozen American soldiers, started towards the castle. They were accompanied by anti-Nazi major josef ""sepp"" gangl, who had defected from the German army. 3. Major gangl's previous actions had gained him the trust of the austrian resistance movement, and his goal was to save not only the prisoners at castle itter but also the local population from the ss (schutzstaffel), hitler's fanatically loyal paramilitary force. Gangl was already considered a traitor to the Nazi cause and had a bounty on his head. 4. Upon reaching castle itter, the motley crew of americans, along with gangl and his German soldiers, managed to free the prisoners. The joint allied-German force then prepared for the imminent ss attack, setting up defenses around the castle. 5. On may 5, 1945, the ss forces attacked castle itter. In the battle that ensued, the German soldiers, along with the americans, successfully defended the castle against the ss attack. The battle of castle itter is an exceptional case in world war ii history where German soldiers fought on the side of the allies. Their decision to cooperate was driven by a shared goal, the chaotic situation in Germany towards the end of the war, and the rapidly shifting loyalties of those realizing the imminent collapse of the Nazi regime."	Castle itter was used by the German ss as a prison for french vips that they considered high-value hostages (former prime ministers, former generals, celebreties, etc)during the end of the war, when Germany's defeat was pretty much set in stone, the German ss had pretty much gone 'f- everyone' and started going around killing any German they would find who was showing the least inclination of just giving up instead continuing to fight against the allies. A group of German soldiers from the regular German army (the wehrmacht) didn't like this, so they joined up with the austrian resistance movement to defend an austrian town near castle itter from these ss reprisals. The ss guards at castle itter eventually abandoned the castle as the allies drew closer, leaving the prisoners there behind (with a single unrelated ss officer who had come to the castle to recover from injuries). They feared the ss would come back however, so they sent a messenger to the town asking for help in defending themselves. The messenger reached the German soldiers, who sent a messenger toward the allied forces to ask for their help in turn. This resulted in a small group of allied soldiers (+ 1 tank), German soldiers and some austrian resistance members arriving at the castle. They, together with the french prisoners and the remaining ss officer there then defended the castle against more than a hundred ss soldiers who'd come back to execute the prisoners until additional allied forces arrived to relieve. The only defender killed during the battle was the leader of the German soldiers, major josef gangl, who was killed by an ss sniper while moving former french prime minister paul reynaud out of the line of fire. Edit: as a sidenote, it was not the only battle in wwii in which German soldiers fought alongside allied forces. Another, operation cowboy, saw a German unit help allied forces penetrate into German-held territory to liberate a stable full of horses from a specific highly-valued horse breed before Soviet forces could take the area, out of fear that the Soviets would slaughter all the horses instead.

For context: ""France, england and the dutch republic defied Spain and Portugal they tried to get colonial products by privateering""."	Privateering is the practice of privately-owned ships attacking and capturing enemy ships during wartime, with the authorization of their government. These private ships, called privateers, were issued a document called a letter of marque, which allowed them to legally plunder enemy vessels. In the context of France, england, and the dutch republic, privateering was a way for these nations to disrupt Spain and Portugal's control over colonial trade and resources.	It was piracy, but with a letter of marque, meaning that the monarch/government gave the pirate the legal right to intercept specific nations' vessels on the high seas. There were usually deals about giving back some of that money to the crown, and you couldn't break the terms of the letter. It's complicated since plenty of famous pirates went through a phase as privateers, and vice versa.

Greece and rome/Italy have existed the entire time?	Ancient historical buildings like the parthenon and the colosseum have deteriorated over time due to natural factors like weather, earthquakes, and plant growth. Additionally, human activities such as invasions, wars, stone repurposing, and vandalism contribute to their disrepair. Despite Greece and Italy's continuous existence, preserving these ancient structures requires substantial financial investment and conservation expertise, which may not have always been available throughout history.	The parthenon is an interesting one. It was mostly intact until 1687. The ottoman empire controlled the city and was using it to store gunpowder. The city came under attack by the invading venetian army, and the turkish garrison withdrew to the acropolis, at which point the structure was struck by mortar fire causing a massive explosion that killed 300 and destroyed the parthenon.

565	6b190c96-c19f-4a55-a031-1c4bf696136d.txt	How did our ancestor deal with dental health before toothbrushes became widely available?	Dental health was maintained in various ways before the invention of toothbrushes. People used natural tools like chew sticks, which were twigs with frayed ends, to clean their teeth. These acted much like a toothbrush, removing food particles and plaque. They often chose twigs with antiseptic properties, which helped kill bacteria and freshen their breath. Additionally, certain cultures used abrasive substances, such as crushed eggshells, ashes, or sand, to clean their teeth by rubbing the mixture over their teeth with their fingers. Mouthwashes made from natural ingredients like vinegar or mint-infused water were also used to rinse the mouth and kill germs. Finally, it's important to note that our ancestors' diet played a significant role in their dental health. They consumed less sugar and processed foods, which are major contributors to tooth decay and gum disease today. This naturally led to better overall dental health.	In addition to sugar being in literally everything we eat now, our distant ancestors also ate things that were much tougher and more difficult to chew. There is a correlation between jaw structure and size and the relative toughness of food. That is to say, as our dietary habits changed to eat softer and more processed foods, our jaws actually shrunk on average over time. So problems like overcrowded or crooked teeth (which are more difficult to keep clean) are also relatively modern. Edit: I should also add that our ancestors didn't live as long, so some modern dental problems associated with old age may not be as prevalent. On the flip side, they may have had problems with teeth literally wearing out because of physical use, which we don't see as much today outside of things like bruxism.
566	37d327ec-19c3-45f4-811e-796d28dd2267.txt	Why almost all ancient civilization have extremely similar stories involving strange creatures like mermaids, big foot, gods, demons and so on?	"The reason many ancient civilizations have similar stories involving mythical creatures and supernatural beings, such as mermaids, bigfoot, gods, and demons, is mainly due to the universal nature of human imagination, cultural exchange, and our tendency to make sense of the unknown. Firstly, human imagination is the driving force behind the creation of myths and legends. Throughout history, people have looked to the natural world and tried to understand it, often defaulting to imaginative explanations when confronted with the unknown. Faced with phenomena they couldn't explain, ancient civilizations personified natural forces into deities and explained unusual sightings with stories of extraordinary creatures. For example, ancient sailors might have encountered large marine animals like whales, sharks, or manatees, which could have inspired the idea of mermaids. Similarly, distant encounters with primates or large mammals could have given rise to legends of bigfoot-like creatures. As humans are inherently creative, these simple observations can evolve into powerful and lasting myths. Secondly, the similarity between myths can be attributed to the cultural exchange that has occurred throughout history between different civilizations. As people traveled, explored, and traded with one another, they brought their myths and stories with them. These stories could then be shared, adapted, and mixed with other myths, resulting in similar themes and creatures appearing in multiple cultures. For example, the concept of a powerful, divine sky god, such as zeus in greek mythology or thor in norse mythology, can be linked back to the feeling of awe people experienced when witnessing natural phenomena like thunderstorms and lightning. This shared experience facilitated the cross-cultural exchange of myths and legends. Finally, the human mind has a natural tendency to seek patterns and make connections between seemingly unrelated events or objects. This is known as ""pareidolia"" and can explain why ancient civilizations ascribed supernatural attributes to events or creatures that seemed beyond their understanding. When faced with an unexplained phenomenon, the human mind often projects familiar patterns, such as faces or figures, onto random stimuli. In conclusion, the similarities between myths and legends in ancient civilizations can be traced back to the universal nature of human imagination, cultural exchange, and our drive to make sense of the unknown. These shared stories have provided civilizations with a way to connect with the world around them and understand their place within it."	"There are many different possible explanations, and the actual real reason is probably some combination of them. One possibility is that different cultures have similar ideas because they historically dealt with similar problems or catastrophes that inspired these myths. For example, a 'primordial flood' is a common idea in mythologies around the world. Ancient peoples around the world probably actually did deal with catastrophic floods that wiped away entire cities. They were built in river valleys after all. An apocalyptic flood in time immemorial could have inspired later story tellers to use that as a common trope for ""a big event that changed the world forever"" similar to how modern day people might use ""zombie apocalypse"" as a common story telling device. Another school of thought, more common among religious studies scholars, would argue that these stories and myths are similar because they serve a similar sociological function. So, it's kind of complicated, but the idea here is that religious (or mythological) beliefs serve an important function for society, fulfilling some psycho-social need. Or possibly, acting as an important symbol for some structure in society, so that people can better understand it. For example, demons and faeries in lots of cultures are said to inhabit 'ritually unclean' places like graveyards, latrines, abandoned buildings, etc. One could argue that the function of these mythological creatures is to personify the otherwise abstract notion that these places are spiritually dangerous. And maybe different cultures have similar ideas, because they have similar needs for symbols like these. Finally, a third explanation would just be cultural diffusion. Maybe they're similar because they're just actually the same idea originally. These are pretty compelling ideas that could easily spread from culture to culture through contact. There's a theory, for example, that the arabic concept of *jinn* (genie) is actually related to the greco-roman conception of *genius* - a gaurdian spirit that could aid a person, or inhabit a place. Ancient civilizations did have contact with each other and might just have shared ideas."

I’m not talking cold war, or even anything after 1900, but basically everything that happened before 1900 for hundreds of years we had things like the holy roman empire and various other entities but from my interpretation of maps I’ve seen, it seems like they were never really able to properly unify it into one state, even well after other countries in Europe, figured out how to be large without all that chaos.	Germany's historical division can be attributed to its complex makeup of various tribes, cultures, and the political structure of the holy roman empire. While other European countries gradually centralized power and formed unified nation-states, Germany remained a patchwork of smaller territories and duchies for many centuries. During the middle ages, the area now known as Germany was home to numerous tribes and cultures, each with distinct identities and regional powers. The holy roman empire, which included most of the German-speaking lands, was a loose confederation of states with a decentralized political structure. The emperor had limited power, and the numerous regional leaders (princes, dukes, and bishops) held considerable autonomy within their respective territories. The thirty years' war (1618-1648) further fragmented the region, devastating its population and economy. After the war, the 1648 treaty of westphalia confirmed the sovereignty and independence of the German states, which further slowed the process of unification. It wasn't until the 19th century, with the rise of nationalism and prussian leadership, that the German states began to unite. Under prussian influence, Germany finally unified into a single nation-state in 1871, forming the German empire.	Other European countries like england or France became hereditary monarchies already in the early middle ages. The holy roman empire, however, was an electoral monarchy. The king/emperor was elected for life, but each time he died, the electors (i.e. , certain powerful princes) were able to elect a new one. Often they elected the previous king's son, but not always. In any case, in order to get elected, the new king had to make expensive promises to the electors, typically giving them a part of the crown possessions. So the crown possessions shrank and shrank, until at the end of the empire, they consisted of nothing more than a few villages in swabia. So the king became less and less powerful and by the late middle ages the empire had become more of a federation, with the king needing the consent of the princes (dukes, counts, bishops and so on) to pass laws or raise taxes. Even today, Germany is still organized as a federal republic, due to this tradition of almost-independent duchies and counties.

The roman empire fell mainly due to a combination of internal and external factors. Internally, it faced issues such as political instability, economic decline, and social problems. Externally, it dealt with increasing pressure from barbarian invasions and military defeats. Essentially, the sheer size of the empire made it difficult to govern and protect its vast territories. As these issues compounded over time, the empire became more vulnerable, ultimately leading to its decline and eventual fall.	Remember the fall of the roman empire took longer than the USA has been a country, it didn’t happen overnight. Lots of factors, partly because it was so large it had to maintain control over large distances without anything resembling modern communication. Imagine it taking days for a message to make it to the recipient if it even got there at all. Then throw in a long lasting severe drought, infighting, and some barbarian hordes and you get the fall of rome.

The tokugawa and date clans continue to exist today because they evolved and adapted to the changing political and social landscape in Japan. When samurai culture declined and the feudal system was replaced, many samurai families lost power. However, the tokugawa and date clans managed to transition from military rule to becoming cultured aristocrats. They diversified their interests into business, politics, and other fields. As a result, these clans preserved their heritage and maintained relevance in modern society, unlike other samurai clans that didn't adapt and ultimately disappeared.	"There are still numerous Japanese clans that are still around, it's just that (like all other families besides the imperial family) their legal status as nobility was abolished by the post-world war ii constitution. For example:* the konoe family, one of the main branches of the fujiwara clan, is still extant. One member, tadateru konoe, is married to a cousin of the emperor. * [oda nobunari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobunari_oda), descendant of warlord and ""great unifier"" oda nobunaga, is an olympic figure skater. * the shimazu family, from the minamoto clan, are still extant, albeit not really doing much."

Didn't colonize africa mainly due to its focus on westward expansion and conquering native American territories. During the 19th century, when European powers were colonizing africa, the u. S. Was focused on acquiring land, resources, and manifest destiny within its own continent. Additionally, the u. S. Didn't have the same imperial ambitions or naval power as European nations to compete for territories overseas, making colonization of africa a less appealing endeavor.	"The US was never much of a direct colonial power. US foreign policy tended to be more of the ""overthrow unfriendly governments in favor of friendly ones"" variety than the ""actually try to govern"" variety, and in that sense, US colonial power was concentrated in latin America (I am genuinely not sure if there is a latin American country whose government the US has not overthrown at least once)."

And if so, why did they believe the USSR would become a global threat after the war?	Yes, other allied nations were aware of the massive loss of life and destruction the USSR faced during the war. Despite this, they feared the USSR would become a global threat after the war because of its strong political and military power. The USSR had a large, battle-hardened army, and they played a major role in defeating Nazi Germany. Additionally, communism, the Soviet union's political ideology, was seen as a potential threat to western democracies. This fear led to the cold war, as western nations wanted to ensure that the Soviet ideology didn't spread beyond the territories it had already gained.	Yes, the western allies were aware of the scale of the fighting on the eastern front and had even supplied some of the industrial capacity to make it happen. They also correctly assumed that the USSR wouldn’t liberate the nations it had occupied during the march to Berlin, but rather install a puppet government to occupy them by proxy indefinitely. The USSR was an undemocratic nation that had itself attempted a genocide in the 1930s against ethnic ukrainians and had invaded Finland to annex territory. It wasn’t all that ideologically different from hitler’s Germany in the eyes of the western allies.

They are in conflict as kosovar albanians desire independence, while Serbia refuses to recognise this. There was a recent escalation as the serbian prime minister claimed the serb minority in north Kosovo are being threatened, and that the nato-led Kosovo force is failing to protect them. The pm also stated they may deploy troops to Kosovo which would radically raise tensions.	Serbia and Kosovo's conflict stems from historical, ethnic, and political differences. The breakup of yugoslavia in the 1990s led to tensions between the majority albanian population in Kosovo and the serbs. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, but Serbia doesn't recognize it. The recent aggression is due to unresolved disputes, such as border issues, and efforts by Kosovo to gain further international recognition, which Serbia opposes.

Was it before or after Reagan?"	"The US's divergence from other developed countries on social policies, like universal healthcare and paid sick leave, has roots in various historical and cultural factors. One major factor is the strong emphasis on individualism in American society, which has led to a preference for limited government intervention. Additionally, powerful interest groups, like private healthcare providers, have actively lobbied against such policies. While this began well before reagan, his presidency did strengthen this trend by promoting free market policies and reducing government spending on social programs. Over time, these ideas came to be portrayed as ""radical left"" due to partisan polarization and the growing influence of conservative ideology."	The US has always been a highly individualistic country. Part of that is just the foundation upon which it was built - the idea that you come here and your station in life is determined by how hard you work (the amerian dream) rather than peerage. Part of it is that as one of the most heterogeneous societies on earth, we have less connection to our fellow americans, preventing us from seeing others as part of our in-group. When all summed up, it created a society where everyone should get what they earn and the government shouldn't step in with handouts to those who are unable to provide for themselves.

The divide and rule policy was a strategy used by the british to maintain control over their colonies, like India, by promoting divisions between different social groups. They did this by favoring one group over another, creating conflicts and distrust between communities. In India, they exploited existing religious, regional, and caste differences to pit groups against each other. This strategy made it harder for the Indian population to unite against british rule, ensuring the colonizers' continued dominance over the region.	If you can get the population of a country squabbling amongst themselves, they might not be unified enough to oppose british rule. I don't remember a lot of details, but India had hindu and muslim populations living side by side, and the brits took advantage of that. It was effective enough that even after british rule ended, the muslims broke away and formed their own country, Pakistan, because they assumed they wouldn't be fairly treated in the new India.

Also a lot of their society is based on confucianism which is a religion that originated in China. How was Chinese culture able to make such a big impact in those countries?	Chinese culture was influential in east asia because China was a dominant and advanced civilization, and neighbors like Japan and korea wanted to learn from them. Adoption of Chinese writing, confucianism, and other elements allowed these countries to benefit from China's intellectual and cultural achievements.	Because it was the only major culture there.

"The middle ages, also known as the medieval period, spanned roughly from the 5th to the 15th century. To better understand this complex era, historians divide it into three key phases: the early, high, and late middle ages. Each period is marked by distinct sociopolitical, cultural, and historical features. The early middle ages (5th to 10th century) encompassed the time after the fall of the western roman empire and the emergence of various ""barbarian"" kingdoms in Europe. The main features of this period include:1. Fragmentation of political power: with the roman empire in decline, numerous tribes and local rulers competed for control, leading to a scattered political landscape. 2. Rise of christianity: the collapse of the roman empire left a power vacuum, which the catholic church filled by becoming a dominant force in religious, political, and social life. Monasteries, for instance, became important centers of learning. 3. Feudalism: under this social and economic system, most people were bound to the land as either landowners, known as lords, or their subordinates, called peasants or serfs. This hierarchy provided stability and order in an otherwise chaotic time. 4. The synthesis of roman and ""barbarian"" cultures: as various tribes and kingdoms formed throughout Europe, they mixed roman and indigenous customs, languages, and legal systems. This gave rise to uniquely European cultures, such as those of the germanic tribes or the franks under charlemagne. The high middle ages (11th to 13th century) were characterized by economic growth, population expansion, and political consolidation. Some important features are:1. Rise of nation-states and monarchies: European kingdoms solidified their borders and centralized power, transforming from loosely connected smaller territories into recognizable modern states, such as england and France. 2. Urbanization: trade networks expanded, and cities flourished, becoming centers of commerce, culture, and intellectual life. This period witnessed the rise of the merchant class and the gradual decline of feudalism. 3. The crusades: conducted between the 11th and 13th centuries, these religious wars aimed to reclaim the holy land from islamic rule. While ultimately unsuccessful, the crusades had widespread social, political, and cultural implications, including fostering cultural exchange and opening trade routes to the east. 4. Educational and cultural advancements: universities began to appear, producing well-educated scholars who engaged in art, literature, and scientific inquiry that would later contribute to the renaissance. Gothic architecture emerged, featuring structural innovations and highly decorative styles that adorn famous cathedrals like notre-dame in paris. The late middle ages (14th to 15th century) witnessed setbacks, crises, and change. Key aspects include:1. Social unrest and upheaval: the period was plagued by a series of crises, like the great famine, the black death, and the hundred years' war. These upheavals brought about political instability, depopulation, and economic distress. 2. The rise of the commoner: as feudalism weakened and mercantilism grew, the importance of the peasantry and the middle class increased. Revolts like the peasants' revolt in england voiced popular dissatisfaction with societal disparities and corruption. 3. The decline of the catholic church's power: scandals, dissension, and the great schism undermined the church's authority, setting the stage for the protestant reformation. 4. The renaissance's precursors: by the end"	"The general dividing lines are these:the fall of the western roman empire in the 400s marks the end of ""antiquity"" and begins the early middle ages, which are often just referred to by some historians as ""late antiquity"". The norman invasion and the crusades of the 1000s typically mark the transition from the early middle ages to the high middle ages. The late middle ages typically begins around 1300 with the black death and the hundred years' war and ends with the expansion of the renaissance out of Italy in the 1500s. It is hard in a eli5 structure to cover everything, but the main features that separate them all (and these are certainly debated) are basically levels of organization -- politically, economically, and socially. The early middle ages are a time of fragmentation -- the roman empire is carved up amongst the German invaders and the vast roman trading and social networks quickly fall apart without the empire to sustain them. Princes and kings try to organize greater political systems but the only one that really manages to stick around through constant in-fighting, viking raids, and economic turmoil is the catholic church. It takes western Europe basically all of the coordination they can muster to keep the invading moors out of France, and even then they have no ability to take back any part of Spain and won't for hundreds of years. By the 1000s, you can start to see the foundations of modern Europe. Places like ""France"" and ""england"" start to take on a familiar shape as political stability takes hold. Trade across the northern seas and the mediterranean starts to grow more standardized and consistent -- a small middle class of guildsmen and merchants starts to grow. European kingdoms are organized enough that when the pope calls for a crusade, these states can actually organize armies and send them hundreds of miles into the levant. There's a renewed interest in greek and roman sciences, backed by exposure to new ideas coming out of the middle east. Everything is bigger and more organized than it was 200 years ago, if only moderately so. By the 1300s, Europe is ""developed"" enough that it can withstand the massive upheavals about to hit it: the black death, peasant revolts, a religious schism, and prolonged war with the turks. European kingdoms are much more stable political entities -- the death of a king doesn't threaten to topple the entire country and the systems of government can (mostly) sustain war or plague without completely falling apart. Countries as we might recognize them today start to exist -- from Sweden to Spain to Hungary. Soon enough these countries will be organized enough to start fielding (and, most importantly, paying) standing armies, something basically unheard-of since the roman times. Add in the printing press and you have set the stage for the renaissance."

"When early civilizations met, they learned each other's languages through a process called ""language accommodation. "" this involved people from both groups learning key words and phrases from the other group, initially by observing gestures and basic actions. Over time, they would slowly build up their vocabulary, allowing for more complex conversations. To simplify communication, they often developed a ""pidgin,"" which is a simplified version of their languages combined. These pidgins eventually evolved into more complex ""creole"" languages, blending grammar and vocabulary from both groups. This process allowed early civilizations to communicate, trade, and develop relationships despite their language barriers."	- context clues: if every time I see you, you say, ‘hello’ then I can start to guess what that means- pointing at things and saying their names - listening to conversations and working out meanings based on context. If someone often says ‘i want bread’ and they get brought some bread, and they also often say ‘i want water’ and they get brought water, you can figure out the meanings of those words. - eventually building up enough basic vocabulary to ask for more complex things: “what’s the word for x”. It’s not necessarily any different to how children learn their first language.

The ability to read hieroglyphs was lost in time mainly due to language evolution and cultural shifts in Egypt over several centuries. To understand this, we need to look at how the use of hieroglyphs was affected by various changes in egyptian society and its influences. Hieroglyphs were the formal writing system of ancient Egypt, primarily used for religious and monumental inscriptions. As with any language, the use of hieroglyphs evolved over time, giving rise to other scripts, such as hieratic and demotic, which were simplified versions of hieroglyphs and more suitable for daily use. The decline of the ancient egyptian civilization and the gradual takeover by foreign powers contributed to the decreasing use of hieroglyphs. During the greco-roman period, greek became the predominant language in Egypt, pushing hieroglyphs to be used mostly for religious purposes. With the spread of christianity in the 4th century AD, greek continued to be the dominant language, and coptic, a script derived from the greek alphabet with some added demotic characters, emerged as the language of the new christian community. Once Egypt became part of the roman empire, the cultural climate shifted again with the rise of christianity. Many of the ancient egyptian temples were closed, abandoned, or converted into churches, which led to a fading connection with the religious and monumental inscriptions that had been written in hieroglyphs. This made the knowledge of deciphering hieroglyphs less relevant and essential to the contemporary society. As the centuries passed, fewer people were able to read and understand hieroglyphs. Eventually, knowledge of the script was lost altogether, and hieroglyphs became a mystery to later generations. It wasn't until the discovery of the rosetta stone in 1799, which had inscriptions in hieroglyphs, demotic, and greek, that scholars were finally able to begin deciphering the ancient script. French scholar Jean-François champollion played an essential role in the early 19th century in decoding the hieroglyphs, thanks to his comparative study of the three scripts inscribed on the rosetta stone. In conclusion, the ability to read hieroglyphs was lost over time due to language evolution, cultural shifts, and the decline of ancient egyptian civilization. Rediscovery and	"In a sense, they didn't. It's more just that they got really really really mangled and simplified. But let's explain:the specific form of writing we call ""hieroglyphs"" today weren't a commonly understood script back when they were used. Only the rich and well educated knew how to read them, because there were literally thousands of individual glyphs you had to learn to read. When the poor eventually did learn to read, they weren't learning hieroglyphics. They were using what was, for lack of a better term, a simplified ""working man's"" version of hieroglyphs we call the ""proto-sinaitic script"". Unalike hieroglyphs, proto-sinaitic was an abjad (consonant-only alphabet). Instead of having to learn multiple thousands of intricate characters to read and write, you had \~30, abstract shapes. It was much easier for the layman to learn, and a lot more practical to use for leaving spur-of-the-moment notes, so it spread like wildfire. Imagine being able to talk to people, in the future, by memorizing about as many shapes as you have fingers and toes. **edit due to new info**: t'would seem sinaitic wasn't the popular kid on the block in Egypt; that crown went to hieratic, and eventually demotic. They were the common forms of writing used by actual egyptian speakers. Similar idea regardless, but I'm gonna dot my I's & cross my T's. That practicality lead to scholars using it to write, and the rest was history. The scratchy glyphs of proto-sinaitc eventually became the modern latin alphabet you're reading right now, as well as things like cyrillic, arabic, and syriac. Demotic meanwhile survives in the coptic writing system. So I guess in theory, you could argue that hieroglyphs never truly 'died'. They just look and act extremely different now. There's a pretty cool video online, ""thoth's pill"", that goes over the history of human writing. I recommend it. Real fun 45 minutes."

At least in the western world, water is commonly available everywhere. Almost everyone has a cup or bottle of water with them, or can you get one at any time in any place. I personally don’t travel to many places without a big canteen or jug of water. Also, considering faucets, filtration systems, etc being everywhere.	Historically, people adapted to limited water access by settling near water sources like rivers and wells, and developed water-fetching and storage techniques. They consumed less purified water and relied on natural filtering or boiling to make it safer. They also drank beverages like beer or wine—which had a lower contamination risk due to fermentation—for hydration. While they didn't carry water with them constantly, they were more accustomed to thirst and would drink when they encountered water sources during their daily activities or travels.	Basically every major ancient city was set up on a river or other fresh water source. The nile valley, mesopotamia, Greece, Italy, pick a notable old city and it's almost certainly built on a riverlater on there were wells, canals, and aqueducts to move water from it's source to a better place for a citymoving fresh water is relatively safe but some people did get sick and some of them would have died. We're just extra paranoid these days but the majority of people are fine without purified water

I understand that you can't repair buildings indefinitely but if they're damaged beyond repair why didn't they knock it down and replace it?	Ruins are present in cities like athens, which has been continuously settled for over 2,000 years, due to a combination of factors, such as historical preservation, practicality, and social or cultural values. Firstly, some structures like the parthenon are considered historically and culturally significant. Instead of demolishing these structures, people preserved them as symbols of their heritage. This preservation allows future generations to appreciate the architecture and craftsmanship of ancient civilizations. Another reason is the practicality of leaving certain ruins in place. In many cases, builders and architects would reuse materials from older structures to create new ones, which was more efficient and cost-effective than starting from scratch. Moreover, some ruins may serve as foundations for newer buildings, acting as a base for further development. Lastly, cities like athens experienced invasions, natural disasters, and economic hardships that may have caused structures to be abandoned or left damaged for extended periods. It was not always feasible or economically viable to rebuild or replace those structures in such situations. In conclusion, the presence of ruins in athens is a result of the interplay between historical significance, practicality, and external factors that affect the city's continuous development. These ruins are not necessarily seen as a hindrance, but they offer a link to the past and contribute to the cultural identity of the city.	"Well same reason why we have abandoned industrial complexes, old abandoned buildings and such. People need to be willing to do something with that ground. Removing ruins takes time and money too... The amount of just burned down or abandoned buildings that litter our modern landscape is quite vast too. In many cases ruins also just just stay landmarksthis is today. Back then all they had were hand tools... Not explosives, heavy machinery, cranes and all that. You are not just ""removing"" structures that are as solid as lets say the Roman Collosseum often times ruins also tend to be mostly foundations. No one bothered to remove foundations so they very much did remove a bunch of it. Just... Put dirt over it and use the square as a market or something. Other times.. Well cities get abandoned by conquest too... Whoever conquered the place doesnt necissarily see maintainance of some places as needed. If Europe wasn't rebuilt with massive efforts after WW2 most of these ruins would still be here. This is how many war torn countries will remain to look like for loong times."

Back when we were getting eaten by cave bears and saber tooth's, there were mere thousands of us on the earth. How did we manage to pull through and make it this far?	Humans became the apex predator mainly due to our intelligence and ability to cooperate. Our ancestors developed tools and strategies that allowed them to hunt and defend themselves more effectively. Additionally, they learned to work together in groups which provided greater strength against threats. This social cooperation extended to sharing knowledge, such as tool-making techniques and effective hunting methods, which helped the entire group survive. As a result, humans were able to overcome fiercer predators, gradually dominating the food chain. Over time, our combined intelligence and cooperation led to advancements in technology, agriculture, and society, allowing us to thrive as a species.	Okay, so imagine a big playground with lots of different animals running around. Some of them are bigger and stronger than us, like lions and bears, but we have something special that helps us be the boss of the playground. We have really big brains, which means we're really good at thinking and solving problems. We can make tools and weapons to help us hunt for food, and we can talk to each other to make plans and work together. That's why we're the top animal on the playground and we can live in lots of different places all over the world!

How on earth did they craft the first tool that was used to create that hammer or axe. I know you can create a hammer from natural material like stone and an axe from a sharp piece of stone but how did they forge the first metal tools and even weapons?	The first metal tools were created using a process called metal smelting, which involves heating metal ores to extract the desired metal. Early humans would gather metal ores, such as copper and tin, from the earth and place them in a simple furnace made from clay or other materials. They would then heat the furnace using wood or charcoal fires, reaching temperatures high enough to melt the metal from the ore. Once the metal was extracted, it could be poured into molds made from stone, clay, or sand to create various tool shapes, such as hammerheads or axe blades. These early metal tools could then be further shaped and sharpened by hammering or grinding them against abrasive surfaces. The breakthrough in tool-making came with the discovery of the process of alloying, which involves combining two or more metals. By combining copper and tin, early humans created bronze, a much stronger and more durable metal than its individual components. This led to the bronze age, where the creation and use of metal tools became widespread, enabling more complex and efficient tools and weapons to be made.	The first metal worked by humans was copper. Copper is quite soft as metals go, can be found (or rather, could in ancient times be found) in its pure metallic form on the surface of the earth, and can be worked with stone tools with effort. It's difficult and labor-intensive, but it'll get you a metal tool with a lot of work. Later on, they figured out how to forge metal using kilns, which were built from brick and ceramic. Even a primitive brick kiln can get up to 1000 c or so, which is more than enough to melt tin (melting point ~400 c) and very close to enough to fully melt copper (melting point 1085 c); a hot kiln could melt copper (in a stone vessel), mix the two metals together, and then pour the resulting mixture into a cast to form bronze. But this was later on; copper was used for a long time before bronze was discovered.

The nobel prize in literature is awarded to authors for their outstanding contributions in the world of literature. However, several famous authors like orwell, joyce, kafka, and tolstoy did not receive this prestigious award despite their significant literary achievements. There are a few factors that can contribute to this discrepancy:1. Timing: the nobel prize is traditionally awarded to living authors, and its selection committee may not have recognized the significance of an author's work during their lifetime. For example, kafka and joyce received significant recognition only after their deaths, missing out on the opportunity to be considered for the prize. 2. Subjectivity: the selection of nobel prize winners involves a degree of subjectivity. Different individuals and generations may have varying opinions on the importance and relevance of a particular author's work. The nobel committee is composed of members with diverse tastes and preferences, so it is possible that they were not unanimous in considering these authors for the prize. 3. Controversy: some authors, like orwell and joyce, created works that were controversial for their time. The nobel committee might have been hesitant to award prizes to authors with works that provoked strong reactions or challenged societal norms, as it could generate negative publicity for the institution. In summary, factors like timing, subjectivity in judging literary merit, and controversy surrounding an author's work can contribute to renowned authors like orwell, joyce, kafka, and tolstoy not receiving a nobel prize in literature despite their significant contributions to the field.	Well, one reason among some others is that nobel prizes aren't awarded posthumously. So, taking kafka as an example (who died at 24), there was scarcely time within his lifetime to award the prize. Moreover, however, nobel prizes are awarded based largely upon what's known *at the time*. We don't always fully recognize artists, including authors, for their impact on a field until after the impact has happened. So, again considering the kafka example, kafka's impact on literature came mostly after his death. Within any given year for these prizes, they try to figure out who made the greatest contribution, but that's really more of a prediction of whose contribution will become the most meaningful *at some later time*. This is possibly more pronounced in the sciences, but certainly pertains to artistic fields. Finally, in addition and on top of these impediments, nobel prizes awards are somewhat political - not like red vs. Blue tribal politics, but the social undercurrents of the different fields, etc. So sometimes the committee simply backs the wrong horse for social/political reasons, and only in hindsight do they come to realize that they should have made a different award (c. F. Irena sendler).

Early empires like the mongols and the roman empire managed their vast territories through a well-organized system of governance, which involved dividing their lands into smaller administrative units and appointing officials to oversee each of them. To maintain control over their vast territories, these empires established strong central governments that relied on a hierarchical system of governance. This hierarchy started with the emperor or ruler at the top, followed by a chain of governors, administrators, and local leaders that supervised and enforced laws throughout the empire. In the roman empire, for example, the empire was divided into provinces, which were further divided into smaller units called cities or civitates. Each province was governed by a governor who reported directly to the emperor. The governor's responsibility was to maintain order, ensure the collection of taxes, and enforce the laws set by the central government. Similarly, cities were led by local leaders who were responsible for managing their communities and maintaining loyalty to the empire. The mongol empire operated in a similar fashion, dividing their lands into regions called ulus, which were governed by a khan or noble who owed allegiance to the great khan. The mongols also relied on a system of local administrators who were responsible for collecting taxes, recruiting soldiers, and ensuring compliance with the empire's laws. Both empires also employed a variety of communication methods to maintain a connection between the central government and the various regions. For instance, the romans used a network of roads and messengers to quickly relay information back and forth, while the mongols utilized a system of relay stations with fast horses to speed up communication. In conclusion, early empires like the mongols and the roman empire kept track of their vast lands through a hierarchical system of governance, dividing the territory into smaller units overseen by appointed officials who were responsible for enforcing the	"The short version is that local powers enforced it for them. Being ""roman"" didn't mean the same thing to all people at all points in time. For example, for some people life as a roman wasn't any different to life before rome. The only difference was that occasionally a bunch of people who spoke a funny foreign language would turn up and demand you give stuff to them, and if you said 'no' then they'd send an army to take your stuff instead. For the same reason, many places stopped being 'roman' by accident - the strange foreign people stopped showing up, and eventually either someone local decided to declare himself king, or a completely different group of foreigners turned up demanding stuff. As for how you keep track of which land is yours... Well, geography does some of that for you. If you come to a big set of mountains or a really wide river and it's a pain in the backside to get across, you just decide that's where your empire ends and hope nobody tells you otherwise. The other thing that helps decide your borders is large groups of people with pointy sticks. If you're stood around and nobody is trying to stab you, then you probably own the place. So you can keep walking forwards until someone points a sharp stick at you and yells ""get lost! "", at which point you declare that to be a border."

The discrepancy in jesus' birth year is due to a mistake made by a monk named dionysius exiguus, who developed the calendar system we use today. He didn't account for the years jesus lived before 1 ad, so jesus was most likely born around 5 bc.	There was no year zero, and no credible scholar of any sort believes that jesus was born at year 1 or -1 because of the calendar. The exact year choice was fairly arbitrary back when our calendar was made and nobody's bothered to fix it.

Just feels like if you’ve got a 20 foot spear pointed forwards, there’s no point in having other people behind you pointing their sticks at the sky.	Phalanxes were multiple ranks deep for increased strength and stability during battle. Think of it like a rugby scrum: the more rows of players, the harder it is for the opposing team to push them back. In a phalanx, soldiers in front held their spears pointed forward to directly engage the enemy, while those behind provided additional pressure and support. If the front line was compromised, soldiers further back could step in and continue fighting, ensuring the formation remained strong and protected against enemy forces.	If one phalanx falls this creates an opening. Say 2 phalanxes fall with 10 in between them, this now creates a pocket and thsoe 10 are surrounded and easily defeated. Holding the line waa the most important stat in ancient warfare. Morale must be kept up and your line must be kept stable. If there is a breakthrough, people start to run. In ancient battles, during the retreat is when 90% of the victims fell, not during the actual battle. So preventing your side started to run was crucial.

In the bc era, mapmakers used a combination of observation, estimation, and local knowledge to create maps. They'd start by observing the landscape and coastline from high points or ships and sketching it out. Then, they'd gather information from travelers, traders, and explorers about landmarks, distances, and directions to make their maps more accurate. This led to largely regional maps that weren't as precise as modern maps.	They weren't accurate. A map might show three towns in a line with the same distance between, but in reality they would be different distances apart and the roads(or rivers) were probably not straight. But if you followed the road or river you'd find those 3 towns in that order, so the map was accurate enough if you stayed on the path.

How did almost every civilization decide that men are superior while very few cultures give females more respect/opportunities?	Patriarchy emerged from early human societies, where physical strength played a significant role in survival and men were generally stronger. This gave men more authority in areas like hunting and warfare. As societies evolved, these roles solidified, and men continued to hold power in various domains. Women often had roles in childbirth and caregiving, which were essential yet considered secondary. Cultural norms, religious beliefs, and laws reinforced this hierarchy over time, resulting in the widespread patriarchy we see today.	Survival bias. Lots of fresh young tribes and similar groups of people form matriarchal or egalitarian structures and customs and do just fine surviving on their own. Over time though eventually tribes grow and spread and meet, and when this happens, patriarchal societies tend to be more eager to go to war, and more likely to win if they do. Over time this compounds to patriarchal civilisations getting larger and more durable, which then keeps snowballing.

Languages developed as humans migrated across the world due to a combination of isolation, culture, and geography. As groups of people traveled to different areas, they became separated from other groups, leading to the development of unique languages within isolated communities. Within these communities, shared experiences and cultural factors influenced the way they communicated, resulting in the creation of new words, phrases, and grammar structures. Additionally, geographical barriers, such as mountains and oceans, further isolated these communities, intensifying language divergence. Over time, these various unique languages continued to evolve, resulting in the thousands of languages spoken around the world today.	Languages change. You probably use some words your parents don't, and won't use some of the words they did. How and why they change depends on what goes on in the group of people who share the language, and if they don't speak very frequently to another group of people for hundreds of years, their two languages gradually drift apart. As far as we know, language first developed 150000 to 200000 years ago. Language differences developed due to the above phenomenon multiplied hundreds of times. I grew up learning norwegian and swedish, which are pretty mutually understandable. I can read danish fine, but have a much harder time understanding it. Icelandic sounds exactly like norwegian tonally, but I can't understand the words at all.

Crossing the rubicon was world-changing because it marked the point of no return for julius caesar, leading to the collapse of the roman republic and the birth of the roman empire. To understand why, imagine the rubicon as a boundary line between two territories. Caesar was a roman general who commanded a large number of soldiers, but roman laws forbade him from bringing his army across the rubicon into the territory where rome was located. This was to prevent any potential abuse of military power by ambitious generals. When caesar decided to cross the river with his troops, he effectively announced his intention to challenge the existing political order. This bold move sparked a civil war, ultimately resulting in the defeat of caesar's rivals and the end of the roman republic. It paved the way for caesar to become the sole ruler of rome and laid the groundwork for the roman empire, which shaped the course of history for centuries.	It was a point of no return. One caesar crossed the rubicon he crossed into Italy proper. And bringing his army across without the approval of the senate was a big huge no-no. Caesar crossing the rubicon is to rome like the shelling of fort sumpter is to the USA. That shelling official started the American civil war, same goes for caesar crossing the rubicon. Had he stayed on the other side, it’s possible that things could’ve been worked out diplomatically. But once he crossed he officially embarked on his journey to be in charge. Now the crossing itself? Eh. It might have not been important at all had caesar lost. Then it would maybe be a footnote that no one cared about. But he didn’t lose. He won. And changed the fabric of the roman empire. Which is a pretty big deal.

Asking this mainly because I've been seeing articles about it and never quite understood how did they get such precise measurements. Thanks in advance.	Scientists measure the land beneath Antarctica's ice using remote sensing techniques like radar and satellite imagery. Ground-penetrating radar sends signals into the ice that bounce off the underlying rock, revealing the land's shape and depth. Satellites equipped with altimeters also measure the ice's surface height, and gravitational data provides information about the continent's mass. By combining these techniques, scientists can create precise maps and models of Antarctica's hidden land features.	"Imagine you are playing a game of ""marco polo"" in a swimming pool. When you close your eyes and call out ""marco,"" your friend will reply ""polo. "" by listening for the sound of your friend's voice, you can figure out where they are in the pool. In the same way, scientists can use radar to figure out what the land under the ice in Antarctica looks like."

First, it's relatively rare, making it valuable due to its scarcity. Second, it has unique physical properties that make it valuable, such as being highly ductile, malleable, and resistant to corrosion. This makes it ideal for creating objects like coins, jewelry, and decorative items. Third, silver has been used as a form of currency in many cultures throughout history, solidifying its status as a valuable resource. Lastly, societies often associate silver with luxury or high social status, which adds to its perceived worth. Overall, silver's rarity, physical properties, historical use, and cultural significance have made it a highly sought-after and precious resource.	"In the old days, things were valuable generally for three reasons:1) they were rare2) people wanted them3) you could be sure what they weresilver isn't as good as gold at those things, but it's not bad. It's rare, it's pretty, and it's relatively easy to tell pure silver from impure silver: because it's relatively dense, it's hard to fake it. Now, the one problem with this is mercury and lead: dipping lead in mercury gives a result that is slightly \*more\* dense than silver (so you leave the lead slightly hollow, or mix it with something less dense) and looks similar (which is why mercury is called ""quicksilver"")."

Yes, other ancient civilizations had travelers and explorers similar to the Europeans. The focus on European history and advancements in schools is primarily due to the widespread influence of European culture and the historical prominence of European nations in shaping the modern world. Ancient civilizations, such as the Chinese, arabs, persians, and polynesians, also had their own travelers and explorers, who made significant contributions to the world. For example, Chinese explorers such as zheng he led large fleets to distant lands, establishing trade routes and diplomatic ties with various nations. Similarly, arab and persian travelers, such as ibn battuta and al-masudi, documented their journeys and gathered valuable information about the peoples and cultures they encountered, which expanded the overall knowledge of humanity. During the age of exploration, which took place from the 15th to the 17th century, European explorers ventured into uncharted territories and initiated contact between Europe and the rest of the world. This led to great advancements in navigation, cartography, and overall understanding of the world and its various cultures. Coupled with powerful European empires expanding their territories and influence, these advancements contributed to significant developments in science, technology, and the arts. The focus on European history and advancements in schools has its roots in the cultural legacy of these European nations. As they colonized and influenced various regions around the globe, they brought along their culture, language, and educational systems. As a result, the European perspective and accomplishments remain entrenched in the educational curricula of many countries, especially those that were former colonies. In contemporary times, however, the growing awareness of the importance of cultural diversity has led to a more inclusive approach in the teaching of history. World history courses aim to give a broader understanding of contributions from various civilizations. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that each civilization has had its travelers, explorers, and contributors to global progress, and it would be beneficial to learn about their achievements and experiences as well.	They did, yes. A samurai named [hasekura tsunenaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasekura_tsunenaga), for example, traveled east across the pacific, all the way across North America, across the Atlantic, visited much of Europe, and returned via colonial-era latin America, for example. Wiki has a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_explorers); here's a few notables:* [zhang qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhang_qian), a 2nd century Chinese explorer who visited much of western Asia and returned to China and is responsible in part for the establishment of the silk road (which would, itself, have hundreds of traveling merchants along its length). * [zheng he](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zheng_he), who explored much of South Asia and East Africa from his homeland in China. * [ibn battuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibn_battuta), a berber who was the most traveled man known in the pre-modern world, who visited almost the entirety of the old world from South Africa to Spain to Russia to China to India. He traveled more than 100,000 km in the 1300s, mostly from 1325 to 1347, which means he averaged around 12 km of travel *per day* for more than 20 years in a pre-industrial world. In addition to these deliberate explorers, you'll find plenty of other people who ended up in cultures wildly different from their own, as with [yasuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yasuke), a slave or servant from Mozambique who ended up in the service of famous Japanese historical figure Oda Nobunaga. We hear mostly about the Europeans because (a) you and I are speaking english and therefore are by nature working within a European cultural world and (b) European colonial power made early European explorers particularly important to world history, because they laid the groundwork for the eventual colonization of most of the world by Europe. To really make the point on (a), ibn battuta's travels weren't known in Europe until more than 500 years after he died, despite there being *tons* of cultural contact between Europe and the muslim world.

In most cases, it’s not about the dead so much as it is about the living. In cases where excavation of ancient tombs is genuinely non-controversial (which is probably rarer than you think), it’s because the population that can best lay claim to being descendants of the dead no longer practice the religion of the deceased and don’t oppose the work and/or are engaged in the work themselves as a form of preservation of national and cultural heritage. In the cases where it’s controversial, the people leading the opposition see the practice as a direct violation of people they still feel kinship with based on ancestry and shared cultural and religious beliefs, and/or experience the excavations as a modern day colonialism in which outsiders are pillaging relics that don’t belong to them for export to benefit nations that have no ethical or cultural claim to the gravesite.	Exploring ancient tombs and studying the remains of centuries-old leaders is often justified by the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of our collective past. While respect for the deceased is important, the significance of these ancient remains lies in the insight they provide into historical cultures, civilizations, and lifestyles. Archaeologists, historians, and experts who excavate tombs do so with great care and consideration. Their intention is not to be disrespectful but to gain a better understanding of human history. By studying the burial practices, artifacts, and remains within these tombs, we can learn about ancient societies, their customs, and their beliefs. For instance, examining egyptian pharaohs' tombs has taught us about their religious beliefs, technological advancements, and artistic styles. In this sense, the knowledge we gain from ancient remains far outweighs the perceived disrespect, ultimately contributing to our present-day understanding of human societies and civilizations.

"The Roman empire's ability to function efficiently despite its massive size can be attributed to its well-organized political structure, sophisticated road system, and efficient communication methods. Firstly, the empire was divided into smaller administrative regions called provinces, each governed by a local authority appointed by the emperor. This decentralized system of governance allowed for more effective and quicker decision-making, as the local authorities had a better understanding of the specific needs and issues within their provinces. Delegating responsibilities and power to local authorities helped to reduce the burden of managing such an expansive territory directly from rome. Secondly, the roman empire was renowned for its advanced road systems. Over 400,000 kilometers of roads were created to connect cities, towns, and military bases. These roads were crucial for facilitating trade, communication, and troop movement. The roman courier system, called the ""cursus publicus,"" was established to allow rapid transmission of messages across the empire. This elaborate system made use of relay stations with fresh horses and personnel, which allowed messages to travel at an impressive speed for the time, ranging from 50 to 80 miles per day. Finally, the roman empire fostered a sense of unity and shared culture throughout its territories via language, law, religion, and military presence. Latin was the common language, roman law was enforced, and the worship of roman gods was propagated. The well-trained and disciplined roman army also helped keep the empire's size manageable by ensuring security and order. In summary, the roman empire was able to function effectively due to its organized political structure, advanced infrastructure, and efficient communication, creating a sense of unity and order across its vast territories."	A big part of why they were so successful for long was that the Romans tended to give local governments a large amount of autonomy as long as they paid their taxes, recognized the authority of rome, and didn't cause too much of a headache for whatever local roman authority there was. So typically after the romans conquered an area (after militarily defeating the locals), they would simply leave most of the local power structures in place, but that local authority now answered to the new roman governor of the area, who was likely in charge of several legions that could completely dominate any potential rebellion. These governors were generally appointed by the senate, or, during imperial times, by the emperor himself and were generally expected to be loyal and keep things under control. The actual duties of provincial governors varied from province to province, but the most important ones generally were in command of large portions of the roman military (and often became contenders for the imperial throne when civil wars broke out). As for communication, they operated fairly independently but would regularly correspond with higher ups (i.e. The emperor), providing updates and requests for guidance or supplies. When actual rebellions broke out, it might be months before help from other provinces might arrive, which is why having a competent governor and having troops stationed abroad was so critical to maintaining control.

"The main reason why American civilizations appeared less advanced compared to their European colonizers is due to differences in technological development, resources, and interconnectedness with other civilizations. Firstly, Europe had access to a wide range of valuable resources, such as metals, fertile land, and domesticable animals. This allowed Europeans to develop advanced systems of agriculture, which led to an increase in food production and population growth. In comparison, the American civilizations had fewer resources and less fertile land, which limited their ability to develop advanced technologies and support large populations. Secondly, Europe's proximity to other advanced civilizations in asia and africa allowed for a constant exchange of ideas, innovations, and technologies. This interconnectedness led to a continuous process of growth and innovation in various aspects of technology, culture, and governance. The American civilizations, on the other hand, were isolated from the rest of the world, which limited their ability to learn and adopt new technologies and ideas from other civilizations. Lastly, Europe's political landscape encouraged competition and progress. The various countries in Europe often competed with each other for resources, land, and influence, which spurred technological and cultural advancements. In the americas, civilizations like the aztecs and incas had centralized power structures, which might have stifled innovation and growth. It is important to note that the term ""advanced"" is a subjective concept. While the European colonizers might have had more advanced technology, the American civilizations had their own strengths, such as their knowledge of crops, architectural achievements, and artistic expression. Additionally, the impact of European diseases, like smallpox, significantly weakened the American civilizations, making it easier for the European colonizers to establish dominance and control over the region."	It's not necessarily that they were less advanced. The aztecs had irrigation and plumbing as well as city infrastructure that was superior to what was seen in Europe at the time. They didn't have weapons on the same level. And the trick is that doesn't matter how advanced your art is, how great you are at agriculture and growing plants, what sort of medical advances you may have made, if someone else has better weapons and can conquer you. Now, part of these you also is that Europe was in a sweet spot that allowed for rapid technological growth compared to most of the rest of the world. It wasn't just comparatively easier access to metals, but also that the mediterranean sea and many large rivers made rapid communication between different civilizations much easier, and that made it much easier for information to travel and thus improve. If someone invents something in rome, it was very easy for that knowledge to make it to France, where it could be improved upon. Likewise, the easier proximity between nations in Europe encouraged wars, which also made them focus a lot more on weapons technology development. So while there are many ways that the natives of the americas had developed, their weapons technology was nowhere near enough to stand the chance against the Europeans. That, combined with the impact of diseases that the Europeans brought, since they were more used to keeping domesticated animals, and of us getting more diseases from those, meant that the native americans didn't stand a chance.

Circumcision is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years, originating from various cultures for reasons like religious rites, cleanliness, and tribal identity. For example, in judaism, it's a covenant with god, symbolizing the commitment to following religious law and maintaining spiritual purity.	Male circumcision was an effective way to mark your tribe from birth in a way adults were unlikely to emulate. Or it could be used as a test of bravery during an initiation into adulthood. Eventually it became associated with certain religions.

During the medieval times in Europe, America was inhabited by indigenous people with diverse cultures and societies. In north America, native American tribes like the iroquois and sioux thrived, while in central and south America, powerful civilizations like the aztecs, mayans, and incas emerged. This era in America was marked by farming, trading, and advanced architecture in major cities.	It was very diverse. North America had a bunch of small nomadic ( or semi-nomadic ) communities, or cultures like anasazi, hopi that settled and inhabited the land permanently. Central America was dominated by the mayans for a long time and later aztecs. South America had multiple cultures which replaced each other over time, ending in inca empire.

Why is it generally agreed upon in western society that he’s a fat old man who lives in the north pole at a workshop with elves and reindeer?	Santa is an americanized version of saint nicholas, derived from the dutch version of the name sinter klaas. Saint nicholas was a roman monk that gave away his worldly possessions (possibly having inherited great wealth) by traveling the turkish countryside and giving it to those who needed help. His story is almost as old as jesus, having originated around 250 ad (possibly as late as 400ad). He was so well liked that he was still celebrated when the catholic church was being reviled in the protestant reformation. Celebrating this real person is where we get almost all the santa related stuff, even the weird stuff because although he was from what is now Turkey, our version of his legends came through the Netherlands and were brought here by the dutch settling in the midwest, so he got retroconned to being a bishop from the Netherlands. The stylized American santa claus came from an artist, thomas nash, who submitted drawings to a magazine, harper's weekly. So santa was real, christian, and told badly over a thousand years, and almost all our christmas traditions come from celebrating a bishop that dedicated his life to serving the poor, except for those that got tacked on during the stories journey through Europe. Edit: saint nicholas's feast day was december 6th, which got combined with the weird idea the jesus must have been conceived and killed on the same day, december 25th is nine months after easter, so obviously jesus was born then. Winter solstice, light festivals, and saint nicholas day got all rolled up into christmas celebrations. When did they decide on december 25th? In the third century, right about when st nicholas lived. It's really unclear whether his giving became associated with christmas, or whether christmas is associated with giving because of him.	"The santa claus mythos that we know today, a jolly old man in a red suit living at the north pole with elves and reindeer, is a result of centuries of cultural blending and storytelling from various sources. To begin, the central figure of santa claus is based on saint nicholas, a 4th-century christian bishop from what is now modern-day Turkey. Saint nicholas was known for his kindness and generosity, and he would secretly give gifts to those in need. His feast day, celebrated on december 6th, became a popular occasion for gift-giving in many European countries. In the early 19th century, American writers began to incorporate various European figures and traditions associated with christmas into their works. The creation of santa claus as we know him was popularized by the 1823 poem ""a visit from st. Nicholas,"" also known as ""the night before christmas"" by clement clarke moore. The poem introduced key elements like making a list, checking it twice, and flying reindeer-led sleigh. Additionally, American cartoonist thomas nast significantly contributed to shaping santa's modern image through illustrations in the harper's weekly magazine during the 1860s. Nast portrayed him as an overweight man with a white beard, wearing a red suit and hat. The north pole as santa's residence likely originated from the same source. The idea of elves as santa's helpers can be traced back to old scandinavian beliefs in house elves who could either be helpful or mischievous. In the mid-1800s, these elves became associated with santa claus in popular literature and folklore, helping him create and deliver gifts. The reindeer part of santa's story comes from the arctic regions' indigenous cultures, where animals like reindeer and caribou were heavily relied upon for transportation. The reindeer connection became widely known after moore's aforementioned poem, which featured them flying santa's sleigh. Over time, these various elements were blended and became popularized through stories, illustrations, and eventually movies and television, leading to the modern-day image of santa claus we know and love in western society."

I’m not American so not savvy on American history, I just pick up bits and pieces from tv, pop culture and such, so maybe i’ve just got the wrong impression. But even after reading some wikipedia pages and other sites i’m still confused.	"The westward expansion in the United states didn't exactly ""skip"" the middle, but the bulk of settlers were drawn to California due to several factors. These included the favorable climate, rich natural resources, and the promise of economic opportunity. First, let's start with the main idea: American westward expansion was a gradual process driven by multiple factors, but certain regions like California attracted more settlers quickly due to their climate, resources, and economic potential. One of the biggest drivers of westward expansion was the concept of manifest destiny, which was the belief that americans had a divine right and duty to expand their territory, spreading their culture and institutions across the continent. This ideology led many settlers to move west in search of land and opportunity. However, the movement wasn't homogenous – different regions attracted different people for different reasons. The central part of the United states, known as the great plains, was initially less attractive to settlers compared to California. The plains were characterized by vast stretches of flat, treeless land, making it difficult for agriculture and settlement. Additionally, the lack of navigable rivers made transportation and communication more challenging compared to coastal areas or those along major rivers. California, on the other hand, offered a mediterranean climate that was conducive to agriculture and the growth of crops like fruits and vegetables. The discovery of gold in 1848 further fueled the gold rush, leading many people to move across the continent to California in search of fortune. The potential economic opportunities attracted not just americans but also immigrants from Europe and asia, resulting in a rapid population increase in the region. The creation of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 made it easier for settlers to access the west coast, further accelerating the process of westward expansion. As time went on, settlers did eventually move into the central part of the United states, driven by the development of new agricultural technologies and the expansion of railroads. This process, however, took longer than the initial movement toward California. As for the indigenous peoples, their history and relationship with the settlers are often overlooked in mainstream narratives of westward expansion. The displacement of native populations, forced assimilation, and conflicts over land and resources are important aspects of this story that warrant further exploration and recognition."	California is a bit of an oddity when it comes to US history. It was colonized/‘taken from native americans’ by the spanish (not the english or french like the rest of the US), and eventually became part of Mexico when it gained its independence in the early 1800’s. It’s a place that’s very rich in natural resources; bay access, rivers, mining, lumber, fertile ground, and great weather. Those all hold fairly true today, which is part of the reason it has about 1/6 of the population of the US. Anyway, back to history. The US gained control of it as the result of a war with Mexico that ended in 1848. Simultaneously, bulk gold was discovered in the mountains, creating the gold rush. Many of the people on the oregon trail were there to participate in that rush (poor souls, the gold rush was terrible for workers). Once they got there, they were too poor to go home, so California became their home. Instead of keeping it as a territory, the US gave it statehood after only 2 years in the union. Because it was previously colonized, and growing from the rush, it had a large enough population that it could be a state. And with the amount of resources, it became rather obvious that it needed to be well integrated at the federal level. So it got a fast track that the desert-filled or less-fertile states didn’t enjoy. It’s also worth noting that the US is massive. It took so long to populate the later states simply because there was no reason for people to move there. There wasn’t enough people. Existing states still had tons of land. Take a look at tennessee, not a particularly big state compared to others, but it’s almost 700km long. Even now, some of those states are sparsely populated, as there’s no particular reason to set up industry there when you need a city’s shipping and utilities infrastructure.

"Rosemary gets its name from latin words ""ros"" and ""marinus,"" which translate to ""dew"" and ""sea"" respectively. Combined, they form the phrase ""dew of the sea. "" this name is likely due to the plant's natural habitat near the mediterranean coast, where it thrives in the moist sea breeze. The name is not related to a person called mary or roses, but rather, it is a reference to the environmental conditions in which the herb commonly grows."	"The name rosemary or rosmarinus comes from the latin ros marinus (genitive roris marini) and means ""dew (ros) of the sea (marinus)"", that is, ""sea dew"". The reason often given is that rosemary bushes grow on the coasts of the mediterranean and at night the dew collects in their flowers. An older interpretation of the origin of the name went back to the greek term rhops myrinos (balsamic shrub). This also includes a possible namesake connection of the greek words libanotis (rosemary) and libanos (incense)."

Molecules vibrate, but breaking them apart requires a precise frequency and energy input. The human body, however, is a complex system with millions of different molecules, each with their own unique frequencies. Trying to target all these frequencies simultaneously would be impossible. Plus, our bodies constantly repair and replace damaged molecules. So, even if some molecules were affected, our natural healing processes would likely counteract the damage.	"I mean... If you put enough force on a human body you can make it disintegrate. We just call that ""dying in an explosion"". If you're asking why human bodies don't have a *resonant* frequency: humans are not a crystal with a regular structure. We contain many different kinds of molecule, all of which vibrate at different frequencies and which interconnect in ways that mix their potential resonances together."

My thinking here is that if my rigid airship body is, say, 24g, with vacuum, why would it float with helium or hydrogen inside, when they have mass and thus weight? Makes very little sense, unless it has something to do with the density?	A vacuum airship would work, as it would have the best buoyancy characteristics compared to other gasses. However it presents a hurdle in that while you can fill a thin bag with helium, how do you get your vacuum chamber to retain its shape under atmospheric pressure? Any container we can build would need to be far heavier in order to retain its shape than its buoyancy can lift.	A rigid airship floats due to buoyancy, which depends on the difference in density between the gas inside the airship and the surrounding air. Helium and hydrogen are lighter than air, creating enough buoyancy to lift the airship. A vacuum has no mass but requires a strong, heavy structure to maintain it, which adds weight. This weight cancels out the buoyancy gained from the vacuum, making it less efficient than using helium or hydrogen.

I also remember hearing that old houses in fl were built with tall ceilings to help cool it off… which seems the opposite of what’s most efficient for home ACs? Feels like i’m missing something.	The main reason why air conditioning is more efficient in stores like walmart with tall ceilings compared to homes with tall ceilings is due to the difference in air circulation patterns, usage of space, and the scale of the building. Let's break down the concept into understandable parts to clarify the differences. 1. Air circulation patterns: in a large store like walmart, the air conditioning system is designed to take advantage of the high ceilings by circulating cool air downwards and pushing warm air upwards to create a comfortable environment for customers. This is done using powerful fans and specialized duct systems that ensure proper air circulation. In a home, however, the air conditioning system usually has only one or two air handlers that cannot create the same level of air circulation, leading to less efficient cooling and a higher likelihood of having warm spots in rooms with tall ceilings. 2. Usage of space: stores like walmart have high ceilings to house large amounts of inventory and create an open, spacious feel for shoppers. This design is intentional and allows for easier cooling as the air can move freely throughout the space. In homes, tall ceilings may not be used effectively, and the space above a certain height might remain unused, leading to a higher need for cooling and higher energy costs. 3. Scale of the building: large commercial stores like walmart can afford to install more robust and efficient cooling systems, which can better handle the vast and open space. These systems are specifically designed to be energy-efficient on a larger scale. Compared to smaller residential air conditioning systems, they can provide better cooling for their intended space at a lower relative cost. Now, regarding the old houses in Florida with tall ceilings, the reason behind this architectural design was to rely on the natural process of hot air rising and cool air sinking, which helped maintain a cooler environment inside the houses without air conditioning. Large windows, ceiling fans, and cross-ventilation technique also helped in circulating air in these houses. However, this method is not as effective in modern air-conditioned homes with tall ceilings, as it can lead to inefficient cooling and higher energy costs. In summary, air conditioning in high-ceilinged stores like walmart is more efficient due to better air circulation, usage of space, and cooling systems designed for large buildings. In contrast, homes with tall ceilings can struggle with proper air circulation and efficient cooling, especially when the design doesn't utilize the space optimally or take modern cooling technology into account.	A tall ceiling does not make air conditioning more efficient, that is efficient in energy usage. The wall area of the building increase if you increase the ceiling height and the result is higher energy exchange with the outside. The increased energy usage will be less for a large building than for a small one. The reason is the walls are a smaller part of the building. Consider a house that might be 15 x 6 meters, the floor area is 90 m^2 and so will a flat roof. The circumference of the house is 2 x (15 + 6) = 42 metersthe inner ceiling is a bit over 2 meters so let's say a 3-meter building height. The wall area is 3 * 42 = 126 square meters. So a total of 126+90 = 216 m^2 outside air. I am ignoring the floor because the ground will be cooler than the outside air. Increase the ceiling height by 2 meters and the total outer area is not 5*42 +90=300 m^2. It is an increase of 40%a store at 80x80 meters has a floor area of 6400 m^2 the circumference is 320m if the walls are 3 meters the wall area is 3*320= 960 m^2 and at 5 meters 5* 320= 1600 m^2 notice the walls have a smaller area than the roof in this case but are lager then the roof for a small house. So the total area is 7360 m^2 and 8000 m^2 the increase is only 8%larger ceiling height makes it easier to install for example air ducts and it makes it feel a lot larger at a relatively low cost. So even if you need a bit more energy for cooling installation of the system to transport the air and another thing will be lower with a high ceiling. You can do a similar calculation and just look at the area hit by the sun but the result will be similar.

I know sound can't be heard in space, but also, people inside a spaceship aren't *in* the vacuum of space. I was wondering if, in a situation where, say, they could hear the boosters of the ship from *outside* of the enclosed space, the sound would still reach them *inside* and if no, if it would get quieter and quieter as they're leaving earth's atmosphere or just suddenly stop?	Sound can't be heard in space because there is no medium through which sound can travel. So you don't need to be in the vacuum, the vacuum just needs to exist between you and the source of the sound; there is no way for the sound to traverse that vacuum even if the source and destination aren't in vacuums themselves. So no sound from the boosters can travel through space outside the shuttle then reach them in side. That said, the boosters are still connected to the shuttle itself and sound can travel through the shuttle and inside and they will still be able to hear that.	Yes, the sound of a spaceship leaving earth would slowly disappear to the people inside of it. This is because sound needs a medium like air to travel through, and as the spaceship ascends, the air around it gets thinner. As the air thins, the sound waves that the spaceship's boosters produce have less particles to travel through, so the sound gradually becomes quieter. Eventually, when entering the vacuum of space where there are no air molecules, sound can no longer travel. So, people inside the spaceship would experience a gradual fading of the sound until the moment when they surpass the earth's atmosphere and the sound completely stops.

Surely with a 360-degree rotation, the opportunity for the blade to be in the right position at the right time is tiny?	Throwing knives work by rotating through the air in a calculated manner, so that the knife's blade hits the target at the right angle and embeds itself. The key to achieving this is by controlling the number of rotations and the distance between the thrower and the target. Skilled knife throwers practice extensively to maintain consistent release technique, timing, and distance. They can predict the knife's trajectory based on their throwing style, and adjust their grip and throw depending on the situation. In a nutshell, it's the combination of skill, practice, and mastering rotation control that allows throwing knives to embed in the target so regularly.	Because we practice consistent throwing and know how quickly the knife rotates. A throw that sticks at ten feet might bounce at fifteen feet, I use my ten foot throw at things that are ten feet away and my fifteen foot throw at things that are fifteen feet away. People who have only practiced for specific distances will stand at those distances to throw a knife. There's also techniques that make the knife rotate less. Some schools that use bo shuriken (spikes, not stars) practice brushing the spike with the fingertips so it doesn't rotate and stays point towards the target all the time.
609	937a147c-add8-4da5-9ac7-503e089cfeaa.txt	Why are binoculars and riflescopes expressed in magnification, but camera lenses are expressed in focal length?	In essence, binoculars and riflescopes are expressed in magnification because their primary purpose is to enlarge distant objects, while camera lenses are expressed in focal length because their main function is to create images with varying levels of perspective and field of view. Binoculars and riflescopes are designed to help users see objects that are far away by making them appear closer and bigger. This is done by using a combination of lenses to magnify the object, which is expressed by the level of magnification. For example, a pair of binoculars with 10x magnification means that objects viewed through the binoculars will appear 10 times larger than they would with the naked eye. Riflescopes work similarly, helping shooters hit targets at long distances by making the target appear larger in their field of view. On the other hand, camera lenses serve a different purpose. Their main goal is to create images, and they have a varying range of applications, from landscape photography to portraits. Camera lenses are expressed in focal length, which is the distance (measured in millimeters) between the optical center of the lens (or the point where the light converges) and the camera sensor when the lens is in focus. This focal length influences the field of view (how much of the scene is visible) and the perspective (how subjects in the scene appear in relation to each other). For example, a wide-angle lens (with a shorter focal length) can capture a wide field of view, which can be great for landscape photography or situations with limited space. A telephoto lens (with a longer focal length) provides a narrow field of view, which is useful for photographing distant objects like wildlife or sports events. Additionally, adjusting the focal length can also change the way objects and distances appear in an image. A wide-angle lens can make objects seem farther apart, while a telephoto lens can make them seem closer together, which is useful for creating a sense of depth or compressing space in a scene. To summarize, binoculars and riflescopes are expressed in magnification because their main function is to bring distant objects closer and make them appear larger, while camera lenses are expressed in focal length because they influence the perspective and field of view of the images they capture. While both devices use lenses and optics to achieve their goals, the key difference lies in their intended applications and desired outcomes, with magnification being the primary focus for binoculars and riflescopes, and field of view and perspective being the focus for camera lenses.	"The practice of using focal length for camera lenses originated from the first bellows cameras. It let you know how far you needed to extend the lens designed for a specific sized image circle for a distant object to be in sharpest focus at the focal plane. When lens mounts replaced bellows and lenses started using multiple elements the industry should have shifted to magnification or field of view, but it didn't. This practice continued until long after it was practical or meaningful to describe a lens by focal length. The focal length is directly related to the size of the imaging circle at the focal plane. The focal length numbers you see are typically referred to as ""35mm equivalent"" meaning that this is what the focal length would have been if it was a lens for a 35mm system. Lots of modern digital cameras have much smaller image sensors than 35mm. The iphone's actual focal length is less than 3mm but it is only ever referred to as a focal length of 26mm as that would be its ""35mm equivalent. ""today all lenses have multiple complex lens elements that allow the designer to place the focal plane at any desired distance from the front of the lens. This means that in practice focal length means literally nothing even on 35mm systems. I have a 35mm lens that is much longer than my 85mm lens. Also note that the imaging circle for 35mm systems isn't even 35mm because of course it isn't. The diagonal of 35mm film is 43. 27mm, so the image circle has to be at least that big to cover the full frame of the film. So what does focal length really mean? It tells you how far from the focal plane the front of the lens would need to be if it were a single element lens and the imaging circle needs to be 44mm and you wanted to focus at a distant object. Implicit in all of this is the thing you really want to know - the field of view of the lens. **tl;dr: camera lenses use ""focal length"" for century-old legacy reasons, none of which make any sense today but it still kind of works because of the relationship to field of view and the standardization of the 35mm format. Binoculars and rifle scopes use magnification and aperture because it's the sane thing to do. **"

When dry, the air between the fibers scatters light, making the clothes appear opaque. When wet, water fills in the gaps and has a similar light-refracting property to the fibers, so less light scatters. This allows more light to pass through, making the fabric appear more transparent. You can think of it like a car windshield when it rains - water droplets can make it difficult to see through, but when wet uniformly, it becomes clearer.	Some stuff is white, because the material it's made out of is white (light in the visible spectrum bounces off of it). Some stuff is white because the material it's made out of is clear, but it has a lot of texture. (light in the visible spectrum passes through it, but gets bent in essentially random directions) for example, frosted glass. If the second type of stuff gets wet, then the water smooths out the surface, so light goes through it in straight lines rather than getting scattered. And voila, see through.

As sunlight passes through the cloud, it gets scattered in every direction by the particles. This scattering causes the sunlight to disperse evenly, creating a combination of all colors, which our eyes perceive as white. Clouds appear less white or darker when they're thicker or have an increased concentration of water droplets or ice crystals.	Because transparent things in tiny bits look white. Whenever light enters or exits a droplet, it changes direction. When it has to go through billions of droplets, it changes directions so many times that it's essentially being randomly scattered, which is the same thing that white objects do to incoming light. It's the same reason snow is white while ice is clear.

(I wouldn’t have clicked on it had it not been for the fact that it was an angle I hadn’t seen before. ) I noticed that as the final ammonium nitrate explosion occurred, the camera was moved and a whoosh was heard before the actual shockwave and boom reached the camera. Shockwaves travels at the speed of sound and this was what was visible as the massive condensation cloud, so what was this force that moved the camera almost as soon as the explosion began?	Some explosions create multiple shockwave-like events. In the case of the beirut explosion, the initial camera shake and whoosh sound came from a smaller, faster-traveling shockwave generated by the detonation. This preliminary shockwave is called ar_valuedet_0_ad#a precursor wave, and it travels faster than the main shockwave because it moves through the ground or air with little energy loss. When the main shockwave, carrying more energy and visible as the condensation cloud, finally reaches the camera, it produces the more powerful shake and loud boom you noticed. The difference in arrival times between the precursor wave and main shockwave is due to their varying energy levels and travel speeds.	Depending on how the camera is mounted it was probably earth shock. Explosive energy doesn't just travel through the air. It also enters the ground. The soil conditions effect how quickly the earth shock wave loses energy. A very tightly compacted soil or bedrock will carry the energy a decent distance before friction eats away at most of the energy. A loose, sandy soil will absorb the wave relatively quickly. Either way, the wave travels more quickly through the ground than the air. Just like an explosion in water will carry the shock wave faster through the water than it will through air.

Bulletproof glass works by combining layers of different materials that absorb and distribute the impact of a bullet, making it difficult for the bullet to fully penetrate. The main idea is to use a combination of hard and soft materials to distribute and absorb the bullet's energy. The glass typically consists of a hard layer, such as regular glass or acrylic, bonded with a soft layer, often made of polycarbonate or other plastic materials. When a bullet hits the glass, the hard layer spreads the impact, while the soft layer absorbs the energy and deforms, stopping the bullet from passing through. The thickness and number of layers in bulletproof glass can be adjusted depending on the level of protection required.	A bit like an ogre - layersbullet proof glass is generally a bunch of layers of hard glass and squishy rubber/plastic. The bullet hits an outer layer of glass and gives up some energy deforming and shattering that layer of glass, that glass then spreads the energy through the squishy layer so it doesn't crack the next layer of glass and the process repeats with the cracking of the glass absorbing a fair amount of energybullet proof glass is generally quite thick which gives it more space to burn off the energy of the incoming bullet. The more powerful a bullet it needs to stop the thicker it needs to be.

The difference in sunlight hue between winter (whitish) and summer (yellowish) is due to the angle at which the sunlight passes through the earth's atmosphere. In simple terms, sunlight has to travel through more air during winter than in summer. During winter, the sun is lower in the sky, meaning that the sunlight has to pass through a larger amount of the earth's atmosphere before it reaches us. The atmosphere scatters shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than longer (yellow and red) wavelengths. As a result, more blue light is scattered away, leaving a whiter appearance to the sunlight. In summer, the sun is higher in the sky, so the sunlight has to pass through less atmosphere. This means that the scattering effect is less pronounced, allowing more yellowish light to reach our eyes and giving sunlight a warmer appearance.	In winter, the sun is lower in the sky, so its light has to take a longer path through the atmosphere to get to you. (since the path isn't as vertical) this longer path means that light get scattered more by the atmosphere, changing its color a tiny bit. **[edit]** this, will make the sun redder when lower. This isn't what you are describing. What you are obeserving is due is most likely due changes in the particles present in the air. Depending on where you live, there might also be more or less particles/water in the atmosphere depending on the season. This will affect scatterring color as well (the amount of moisture in the air can vary *a lot* depending on temperature)
615	213639cc-acd6-4d60-a9c4-cb57d5c20ac8.txt	How can a collision cause a loss of energy? Even if friction and energy loss is ignored? 	There isn't any energy loss. It's conserved. There is a \*kinetic\* energy loss because, in most collisions, there's heat, sound, and (often) distortion of the colliding objects. The energy changed forms to some that aren't kinetic, so naturally you've got less kinetic energy after than before. Your second equation (vf2=...) is just conservation of momentum. This doesn't looks like it's an energy question.	In collisions, energy can be lost through sound, heat, or deformation of the objects involved. In your homework question, energy loss occurs when the two blocks collide and transfer energy between them. Even if friction is ignored, some energy may be used to compress or change the shape of the blocks. This energy transformation results in a decrease in kinetic energy, which appears as energy loss.

When black light, which is essentially ultraviolet (uv) light, passes through a prism, it gets separated into different wavelengths just like visible light does. However, since our eyes are unable to see uv light directly, we wouldn't be able to observe the spectrum. Instead, we might see a faint violet or purple light at the edge of the visible spectrum, which is the closest color to uv light that our eyes can detect. Some materials, such as fluorescent paint or certain minerals, can absorb the uv light and re-emit it as visible light, allowing us to see the effects of black light when it passes through a prism.	By black light, I assume you mean ultraviolet light. It gets refracted just like visible light. So, it would come out of the prism at an angle depending on its wavelength just like visible light does. In fact. I bet you could test this if you could mask around the prism to block all light around the prism and then shine a black light through the prism and see where on the other side something fluorescent would glow. That might be kind of cool. All wavelengths of light from radio waves to gamma waves can be refracted by a prism, but they might need a different kind of prism material depending on the wavelength.

When a car is submerged in water, the pressure outside the car door becomes much greater than the pressure inside the car. This pressure difference makes it very difficult to open the car door because the water outside is pushing against it with great force. Imagine trying to push a balloon against a wall. The air inside the balloon pushes back, making it difficult for you to flatten the balloon completely. In the case of a car door, the water outside acts like the air in the balloon, and the car interior is like your hand trying to push the door open. To overcome this pressure difference and open the car door, you would need to equalize the pressure inside and outside the car. One way to do this is by allowing the car to fill up with water, but this can be dangerous as it can reduce the time you have to escape.	Because the pressure of the water pushing onwards on the car is far greater than the pressure of the air in the car pushing out. In day-to-day lives, the pressure is essentially equal, so there is little to no imbalance in force, so it is easy. If you want to feel these forces, grab a plastic bag, put it over your hand, and try to hold your hand open (kind of like a claw) as you start putting your hand into a container of water (just make sure the water doesn’t spill into the bag). You will feel the pressure of the water pushing in. As an extra extension, if/when you let the water rush over the top of the bag, filling it, the pressure will become balanced again and it will be easy to love the bag.
618	f6fa5f6c-2dc8-47c6-9374-e95d2a61438e.txt	How do we know the half life of (or even that it is radioactive) bismuth-209 when it is literally longer than the age of the universe by several orders of magnitude?	You can calculate the half-life of a substance by measuring the rate at which it decays. Bismuth-209 decays by releasing alpha particles, which is a helium nucleus - two neutrons and two protons. In 2003 scientists at institut d’astrophysique spatiale in France took a sample of bismuth-209 and connected it to a very sensitive detector, and measured how many alpha particles it released over the course of 5 days. If you know the mass you started with, you know how many atoms you had, and if you know how many alpha particles were released, you know how many of those atoms underwent decay. You can extrapolate from that to know how long it would take for half of the atoms in the sample to decay, and that's your half-life. In the case of the bismuth-209 experiment, they had something like 128 alpha particles, total, from 100 grams of the substance. Considering that's like 3x10^23 atoms, and only 128 of them underwent decay in 5 days, that's an extremely tiny fraction of the sample. Hence it having a half life of 10^19 years.	"The half-life of bismuth-209 is indeed incredibly long, estimated at around 2. 01 x 10^19 years, far longer than the age of the universe. We know it's radioactive and can determine its half-life using statistical methods and sensitive instruments. To understand how scientists calculate half-life, let's imagine rolling a die with countless sides, where each number represents a different radioactive isotope. When this special die is rolled, the half-life of that isotope is the amount of time it would take for half of it to ""decay"" or change into another element. For example, if you had 100 bismuth-209 atoms, the half-life would tell us how long it takes for 50 of those atoms to decay. Since bismuth-209 has such a long half-life, directly observing the decay of one atom would take a very long time. Instead, scientists use large samples and measure the overall decay rate of the atoms in the sample. Think of it like rolling our unique die many times and recording the outcomes to better predict the average outcome statistically. Sensitive instruments, such as gamma-ray spectrometers, measure the radiation emitted from the decay of these isotopes. This data is then analyzed to estimate the half-life of bismuth-209, despite it being much longer than the age of the universe."
619	686e862e-99ea-4f5f-a2ad-e212e2099690.txt	Why are my windows wet inside?	Windows get wet inside due to condensation, which occurs when warm, moist air comes in contact with the cold window glass. The warm air can hold more moisture than cold air, so when it touches the cold surface, the moisture turns into water droplets. This often happens in the colder months or in rooms with high humidity, like bathrooms. To prevent this, you can improve insulation, reduce indoor humidity, or increase air circulation near the windows.	Warm air can take up more humidity than cold air. The air near the windows is cold because it’s cold outside. When warm air loaded with humidity passes near the windows, it cools down and loses its ability to hold that much water. The water then condenses out of the air and ends up on the windows. Well, either that, or someone just washed them, I don’t know.

"When you see an image of an [ac waveform of electricity](https://oxscience.com/difference-between-ac-and-dc/), it usually looks like a nice perfectly uniform sine wave. In reality, the electricity you receive from the power grid is rarely that uniform. Real electrical grids are subjected to all kinds of disturbances. Power plants trip offline, trees fall on power lines, lightning strikes, voltage surges and sags, breakers trip open, capacitance, harmonics, etc. The culmination of these perturbations is referred to as ""[dirty power](https://haasentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dirty-power-spikes. Png)""certain sensitive electronics, as well as industrial equipment can be affected by dirty power."	Clean electricity refers to power generated from sources that produce minimal or no harmful emissions, like solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy. Dirty electricity, on the other hand, refers to power generated from sources that emit pollutants or contribute heavily to climate change, such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. By using clean electricity, we can reduce our environmental impact, protect public health, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Thus, transitioning from dirty to clean electricity is vital for a sustainable future.

This phenomenon is known as ""time dilation"" and occurs due to the bending of spacetime by massive objects, like planets or stars, as described by einstein's theory of general relativity. Imagine spacetime as a trampoline and a heavy ball on it, causing the trampoline to curve. The closer you are to the ball, the steeper the curve and the slower time passes. For example, a clock at sea level (stronger gravity) runs slightly slower than a clock on top of a mountain (weaker gravity). This difference is tiny but measurable with precise instruments."	Massive objects curve space. (edit... It curves spacetime, I know... But for this analogy let's say it curves space) the closer you are to one, the more the curvature. (edit: think of a heavy ball on a flexible rubber sheet) two points on a flat surface are closer (straight line…closest distance between points) than the same two points when you curve the surface. So if you travel between the same two points when you’re near a massive object, the curvature of space leads to you taking more time. So, time moves slower closer to massive objects. &#x200b;this is a direct result of general relativity and has been proven experimentally.

So if an a is 440Hz, why does a piano playing an a sound different than a violin, a guitar, or someone’s voice making that same a 440 note? It’s obvious that the pitch is the same on each instrument but each instrument has a distinct sound. I’ve never heard an a on a piano and thought, is that a piano or a cello. Why can we distinguish between instruments?	"Different instruments produce unique sound qualities, called ""timbre,"" due to varying overtones created when a note is played. The overtones, which are multiples of a note's fundamental frequency (e.g. , a at 440 hz), combine with the fundamental frequency to create each instrument's distinct sound signature, allowing us to distinguish between them."	Timbre is the word that describes the quality you're describing. While pitch is the frequency of the note, 440 hz for a, the shape of the sound wave is not a perfect sine wave. The variation in the shape of the wave will contribute to the quality of the sound.

I know that its something to do with the G forces it puts on your body, but like what does that actually even mean? Can’t you just force yourself to breathe anyway?	The euthanasia coaster kills you by using extreme g-forces, which deprive your brain of oxygen. It has a series of loops that increase in size, causing you to experience intense g-forces that force blood to flow away from your brain. As a result, your brain is starved of the oxygen it needs, leading to unconsciousness and eventually death. During this process, forcing yourself to breathe wouldn't counteract the g-forces' effects.	The sheer scale of the coaster and the prolonged exposure to high G forces is what is supposed to do you in. A normal person can survive a couple G'S for a couple seconds, but when youre facing 10 G'S for multiple minutes, the blood and oxygen simply cant get to your brain and we know we have to continue to breathe to survive.

I lit a candle and when I waved the long match to kill the flame, it sounded like waving a tiny flag.	When you wave a flag, the sound you're hearing is displaced air. You're pushing the air molecules out of the way. Waving a small hot thing around does the same thing. Displaces the air molecules, because heat makes them move faster. You've also got the added bonus of the fire sucking oxygen from the surroundings, which also causes molecules to move, rushing in to replace the ones consumed by the fire.	Waving a stick on fire and waving a flag sound similar because both actions create disturbances in the air. When you wave either object, you're causing air molecules to move and create pressure waves, called sound waves. These sound waves travel to our ears, and we perceive them as the rustling sound. Although the materials are different, the rapid movement of air caused by the waving motion results in a familiar sound for both cases.

A sonic boom occurs when an object travels faster than the speed of sound, creating pressure waves that build up and eventually merge into a single shock wave. Think of a boat creating waves as it moves through water; when it goes fast enough, those waves combine into a large wake behind the boat. When scientists first broke the sound barrier, they had some understanding of sonic booms, but the actual experience was still surprising to many. Sonic booms are guaranteed to happen when an object exceeds the speed of sound. The intensity and sound of the boom depend on factors like the object's size, shape, and speed, but some form of sonic boom will always occur when breaking the sound barrier.	One correction to several people in this thread. The sonic boom is not made only as the aircraft passes thru the speed of sound. Any supersonic object is constantly making a sonic boom. Just like a boat is constantly making a wave, so too is a supersonic aircraft constantly making a sonic boom. The wave/boom just tends to only hit you once. To answer op's third question. Yes, every supersonic object will create a boom. But depending on the size and speed and noise generation, may not be that loud. The crack of a whip is a sonic boom, as the tip of the whip goes supersonic. The zip of a bullet flying by is also a sonic boom.

My husband told me that color is a perception that our eyes create and it doesn't exist, but even if all colors were gone things would still be grey, wouldn't they?	"Color is a perception created by our eyes and brain when they interpret different wavelengths of light. Objects don't ""have"" color, they simply reflect or absorb certain wavelengths. Our eyes detect these wavelengths and send signals to our brain, which processes the information and creates the experience of color. If all color were gone, it wouldn't necessarily be gray; there would simply be no perception of color, as everything would absorb or reflect the same amount of light."	"From a particular viewpoint, it is correct that color as we commonly use the term is perceptual and there is no way to determine what color ""is"" as far as it is individually perceived. On the other hand, color defined as certain frequencies of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum is objective and empirical. Whether or not there is a human observer, such frequencies of radiation would continue to exist."

All the science stuff says the universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate. However, when reading about the possibilities of creating micro-universes (like in colliders), they say that those universes would appear to decay quickly from our outside perspective. Wouldn’t it make more sense that our universe is a micro-universe, which ought to be common for the same reason simulates universes are common, and that it’s decaying? What’s the difference between space expanding and the stuff within space all shrinking? Would the distinction even matter from an “inside” perspective?	"The evidence for the universe expanding comes from observing the redshift of light from distant galaxies. The redshift indicates that galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther away they are, the faster they're moving. This suggests the universe is expanding, rather than objects shrinking. While shrinking objects and expanding space might seem similar from an ""inside"" perspective, the observed redshift phenomenon aligns with the expansion model. To consider our universe as a decaying micro-universe, we would need different observations that contradict the current evidence for expansion."	It's not that we see it getting smaller, it's that the light the stuff emits is getting *redshifted*it's similar to how a siren from an ambulance sounds lower pitched as it moves away from you as opposed to moving towards you. Light emitted from things moving away from us is shifted to longer wavelengths/lower frequencies. Almost everything out of our near galactic neighborhood has had the light they emit shifted to this lower frequency, meeting theyre moving away from us, and the distance they're moving away is directly related to how fast they're moving.

"Sound waves travel by vibrating tiny air particles, while wind moves air in a general direction. The vibration of the particles is not easily disrupted by wind because the particles rapidly return to their original positions after the initial disturbance. In essence, the vibrating motion of sound waves is much faster and ""stronger"" than the wind's ability to disrupt it."	Because the speed that sound waves travel is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay faster than the speed of a wind gust. If you got hit with a gust of wind fast enough to meaningfully displace a sound wave mid-travel, you would be instantly killed. It would be like the blast wave of an explosion.

But turn them around and look through them the other way - things still get bigger! The curve makes no difference? Why not? And if it makes no difference, why are they curved?	Reading glasses have convex lenses, which means they're thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges. Regardless of the direction you look through them, these lenses bend light in a way that makes things appear bigger. This is because convex lenses bring light rays together (converge), magnifying the image. The curve is important because it aids in focusing light correctly onto your retina, helping you see clearly and making nearby objects appear larger and easier to read.	The curve you're thinking of is a red herring. They are curved for looks and convenience, but this does not do much lensing. The real lensing happens because the edges are thinner or thicker than the center. A magnifying glass has a thicker center than edges, and so under certain circumstances it makes images appear bigger. If you curved the lens a bit, it would still work the same way.

The main reason why the artemis capsule is entering earth's atmosphere faster and hotter than the apollo mission is due to its higher return velocity. To understand this better, picture a ball thrown upward. The higher it's thrown, the faster it will come back down. Similarly, artemis has a higher return velocity because it is coming back from a deeper point in space (the moon) than the apollo missions. This increased return velocity causes the capsule to hit the atmosphere at a faster speed, creating more friction with the air molecules. This friction generates heat, and the faster the capsule moves, the more heat is produced. The heat generated during artemis' re-entry will be greater than during the apollo missions because of the increased speed. To protect the astronauts and the capsule, engineers have designed advanced heat shields that can withstand these higher temperatures, ensuring the crew's safety during their return to earth.	The why is because the orion capsule is designed with potential return missions from mars in mind. Longer distance means higher speeds to keep travel times reasonable and decelerating with fuel means more mass, so they want to do as much braking with atmosphere as is possible. Returning from the moon re-entry speeds are about the same but temps and force should actually be a bit less than apollo with navigation equipment letting them do a skip entry, slowing down over a longer period, and giving them more control over the landing site. As for how, while the ablative material on the shield is essentially the same as apollo, modern alloys, manufacturing processes, and simulations let them build the whole thing lighter. And since lighter takes less force to decelerate it generates less heat and burns off less heat shield compared to the heavier apollo capsules.

When rubbing various surfaces together (like when putting on a sweater) you cause some electrons to leave their orbits. This leads to an accumulation of static charge represented by such displaced electrons. When you then touch a conductive object - like another person or a piece of metal, especially connected to the ground - that charge discharges, producing the zap. This happens more often in winter because the air tends to be dry in winter, preventing natural discharge. Water is a conductor so higher air humidity means that the displaced electrons can go back to their orbits fairly quickly and don’t accumulate.	The occasional zap you feel when touching someone, especially in winter, is called static electricity. It happens when two materials rub against each other, causing a build-up of electric charge on their surfaces. When you touch someone or an object, this built-up charge gets released, creating a small electric shock, or zap. In winter, the air is drier, which allows static electricity to build up more easily. A common example is shuffling your feet across a carpet and then touching a doorknob, causing a spark. To prevent static shocks, you can touch a metal object, like a key, to discharge the built-up electricity safely.

Plane trails, called contrails, are formed when hot exhaust from plane engines meets the cold air of the upper atmosphere. The moisture in the exhaust turns into ice crystals, creating a trail of clouds. The visibility of contrails depends on factors like humidity, temperature, and altitude. If the air is too dry or warm, the ice crystals will evaporate quickly, making the trail invisible. In colder and more humid conditions, the contrails can last longer and appear more prominent.	It's not so much the aircraft, but the surrounding air, that decides if a contrail forms. The engine exhaust contains a lot of water. If this water can stay in invisible vapor form or must become a visible liquid depends on how hot and humid the surrounding air is. This varies with time, location, and altitude, so you can have two planes fly by where one leaves a train and the other does not simply because of different altitudes.

If an explosion happens in an massive vacuum it will keep expanding right?	The expanding universe can be a puzzling concept because it's not just a simple explosion of matter into empty space. Instead, it's the expansion of the space itself that causes things to move away from each other. Imagine a rubber band with evenly spaced dots on it. As you stretch the rubber band, the dots move away from each other, not because they are being pushed or pulled, but because the space between them is expanding. This is similar to how galaxies are moving away from each other in the universe. The main question people have about the expansion is what is driving it. Initially, it was thought that the expansion would slow down over time due to gravity. But recent observations have shown that the expansion is actually accelerating, which suggests there's something else at play. This unknown force is called dark energy. Scientists are still researching to understand the nature of dark energy and why it's causing the universe to expand at an increasing rate.	"If an explosion happens in an massive vacuum it will keep expanding right? Not necessarily, no. Gravity will act to slow down the expansion, and maybe even bring the expansion to a stop and then reverse it, depending on how strong the initial explosion was. But that's all beside the point, since the big bang was *not* an explosion of stuff into an empty vacuum. It was a ""metric expansion"" of space itself—brand new space appearing in between the universe's contents—transforming the universe from hot and dense *everywhere* to relatively cool and spacious everywhere. The ongoing expansion of the universe we see today is much the same, just at a slower rate; it its *not* the motion of stuff through space, but the expansion of spacetime, driven not by the inertia of matter from an initial explosion, but by the energy bound up in space itself. That's why the universe isn't just expanding, the expansion is getting *faster* over time."

In simple terms, mass is the amount of matter in an object, while weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass. Mass is measured in units like kilograms and remains constant no matter where you are in the universe. On the other hand, weight is measured in units like newtons and depends on the gravitational pull of the planet you're on. So, if you go to the moon, where gravity is weaker, your mass stays the same, but your weight is much less. Essentially, weight is how ""heavy"" an object feels due to the influence of gravity."	Weight is dependent on gravitational force. It's a measure of that gravitational force, usually on earth. Mass, which measures the amount of matter in an object, exists whether gravity acts on it or not. The same object has the same mass on earth, the moon, or in the middle of space, but has different weights at each of those locations. However, on earth weight can be used to measure mass. Since the same gravitational force acts on all objects in the same place on earth, comparing their weights will reveal their mass. On earth, mass equals weight divided by the acceleration of gravity.

If a mirror is supposed to reflect everything coming to it, why is it not just white? If I place a white paper next to a mirror and stare at them, what’s the difference in what each of them are reflecting?	A mirror doesn't just reflect all wavelengths of light like a white surface, it also maintains the direction and organization of the light. A white object scatters light in all directions, mixing the colors, while a mirror preserves the original light without scattering. When you look at a white paper, you see the mixed light, which gives the white appearance. In contrast, looking at a mirror, you see an organized reflection of the objects in front of it instead of a single color.	There’s two kinds of reflection, called specular and diffuse. A mirror is specular, and that means that it reflects all the light back out at exactly the angle it came in on, effectively making a new image just as good as the original. A piece of paper is diffuse, so when light hits any point on it the light reflects off in all directions, not just one. That obliterates any image information the light might have had before hitting the paper.

"Negative G-force is the sensation of weightlessness or being pushed upward, often experienced on roller coasters or in aerobatic flights. It occurs when an object's acceleration is greater than earth's gravity, causing you to feel ""lifted. "" this sensation feels weird because our bodies are accustomed to a constant downward pull due to earth's gravity. When experiencing negative g-force, blood rushes to our head, our internal organs shift, and pressure changes in our ears, all of which contribute to the disorienting feeling."	It's when you are being forced upward. For example, at the crest of a hill of a high-speed roller coaster where your momentum is going up from climbing the hill but the coaster's track curves downward faster than the parabolic trajectory you would otherwise travel. We're used to being held down by gravity, so when a situation occurs that makes up feel like we're being shot upward, it feels unusual to us. Particularly as we feel our organs being lifted inside our bodies.

Water makes surfaces slippery or grippy depending on their texture and the material they're made of. For smooth surfaces like a wet floor, a thin layer of water creates lubrication, reducing friction and making it slippery. On the other hand, with porous materials like socks, the water is absorbed and creates additional friction between the fibers. This increased friction between the wet socks and your skin makes it harder to slide them off, making them grippy.	"Friction coefficients! A smooth floor surface already has a low friction coefficient, so objects are already likely to slide. Water tends to attract itself, and therefore form a barrier which is also super low in friction, so you slide even more. Fabric on the other hand tends to have a higher coefficient to start. And the water isn't able to ""bead"" together, instead it gets absorbed and makes the fabric even more pliable. As a rule, pliable/bendable is very, very high in friction."

A GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) receptacle is a safety device designed to prevent electrical shocks and fires by quickly cutting off power in case of a ground fault. A ground fault occurs when electricity unintentionally flows outside its normal path, potentially causing serious injuries or fires. To understand how a GFCI works, imagine your home's electrical system as a water system. Electricity flows through wires like water flows through pipes. In a normal situation, the water (electricity) flows smoothly through the pipes (wires) without any leaks. But if there's a leak (ground fault), water (electricity) escapes and goes where it's not supposed to. The GFCI receptacle constantly monitors the flow of electricity and detects any imbalance between the incoming and outgoing currents. In a well-functioning circuit, these currents should be equal. However, if a difference is detected, which could be due to a ground fault, the GFCI receptacle immediately interrupts the flow of electricity to eliminate the risk of electrocution or fire. Typically, GFCI receptacles are installed in areas where there is a higher risk of electrical shocks, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and outdoors. By providing an extra layer of protection and monitoring, GFCI receptacles help keep you and your home safe from electrical hazards	Assuming you mean a a GFCI, which is a ground fault circuit interrupter. Usually when you use an electric device, the current that flows in the live line also flows in the neutral line, since when an electric device is active it connects the live and neutral lines. If there is current flow in the live line but no (or less) current flow in the neutral line, that means the live line is connected to ground somehow, and all or a part of the current is returning to ground instead of the neutral line. This is called a ground fault, and it's bad because it's not supposed to happen, and usually the thing connecting live to ground is either you, or something you could touch. So whenever a ground fault is detected, a GFCI will interrupt all power to that outlet to keep you safe. Gfci outlets are generally required in bathrooms and kitchens, since getting a device wet is a very common thing that can create a connection between the live and ground, or between live and you.

"The ""blurry trail"" you see when an object moves very fast is due to the way our eyes and brain process visual information. Our eyes have light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors, which send signals to our brain when they detect light. These signals take time to fade, which is called ""persistence of vision. "" when an object moves fast, the photoreceptors in our eyes continue to send signals even after the object has left that position, creating a brief afterimage. Similarly, our brain takes some time to process visual information, causing a slight lag. When you add these two factors together, you get the effect of the blurry trail. It's our brain essentially playing ""catch-up"" with the rapidly changing visual input."	"Your vision is imperfect, just like a camera. The photosensitive cells in your eye have a certain persistence, that is, it takes non-zero time for them to change output based on change in the light being projected on them. In very simplified terms, what each of them tells you is averaging of the amount of light over a certain short period of time. If you flick your finger fast over some background, a significant part of this ""exposure"" time the area you are looking at was taken by the background itself, with a bit of finger mixed in. The resulting average that each cell reports is therefore something between the finger and the background color, forming a semi-transparent trail where the finger has passed."

I did some reading about harnessing the apparent wind (the resulting wind summing true wind and boat-moving wind), thus the faster you go the faster you can go, but am still confused. Doesn't this defy the lows of nature?	Sailing faster than the true wind speed is possible due to the combination of two types of wind: true wind and boat-moving wind. The resulting wind, called apparent wind, is what the sailor actually feels and uses to propel the boat. Imagine a person riding a bicycle. The true wind is the actual wind blowing, while the boat-moving wind is created by the bike's forward motion. As the bike speeds up, the person feels a stronger wind called the apparent wind, which appears to come from a different angle. Similarly, in sailing, a high-performance boat with efficient sails can angle itself in such a way to move faster than the true wind. It does not defy the laws of nature but utilizes the interaction between the true wind and boat-moving wind to harness more energy, which increases the boat's speed.	The key to understanding this is that you aren't sailing in the direction of the wind. If you move in the direction of the wind then when you reach its speed there will be no apparent wind speed, since the wind isn't moving any faster than you are. Instead the boat is moving in a direction somewhat perpendicular to the wind. The wind applies a pressure on the boat via the sail, and the keel directs this pressure into movement in a different direction. Because the boat is moving across the direction of the wind even if it reaches the same speed as the wind there is no diminishing of the apparent wind force. Under those circumstances it is possible to move even faster than the true speed of the wind.

The system uses two coolants, the first of which performs evaporative cooling and is then absorbed into the second coolant; heat is needed to reset the two coolants to their initial states. The sealed system of a propane-powered fridge holds water, liquid ammonia, and hydrogen gas. A propane flame heats the water and ammonia to its boiling point in what is called the generator. The now-gaseous material then rises into a condensing chamber where it cools and returns to a liquid state. This fluid then flows into another chamber - the evaporator - where it mixes with hydrogen gas. It’s here that a chemical reaction occurs that pulls, or absorbs, heat from inside the refrigerator. Once the solution absorbs enough heat, the ammonia returns to a gaseous state, starting the process over again. This self-contained system doesn’t rely on mechanical, or moving parts, meaning these units remain reliable for years.	A propane-powered cool box, also known as an absorption refrigerator, uses a unique process to cool down without relying on a compressor like a traditional refrigerator. Despite burning gas and generating heat, the heat actually helps drive the cooling process. The main idea behind absorption refrigeration is the use of a heat source, in this case, propane, to separate a refrigerant, usually ammonia, from a solution, typically water. When propane burns, it heats a mixture of water and ammonia. The heat causes the ammonia to evaporate and separate from the water, traveling in a gas form to another chamber. There, the ammonia gas releases its heat and condenses back into a liquid, removing warmth from the inside of the refrigerator. As the liquid ammonia flows back, it mixes with the water again, repeating the cycle. In essence, the heat generated by the propane is used to create a cooling effect through a continuous cycle of evaporation and condensation driven by the unique properties of ammonia and its interaction with water.

Surely it's the gas, not the glass that insulates, so why add more glass rather than a thicker gas layer? Thank you!	Triple glazing is more insulating than double glazing because it incorporates an extra layer of glass, creating two separate pockets of insulating gas rather than just one. Although the gas between the glass layers plays a crucial role in insulation, adding more glass and gas layers improves the overall insulating properties of the window. The main idea behind insulation is to minimize heat transfer between the interior and exterior of a building. This can be achieved by minimizing the three key heat transfer mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. Let's break down how triple glazing tackles these mechanisms more effectively than double glazing. 1. Conduction: this is the transfer of heat through direct contact between materials. Glass is a better conductor of heat than the gas (usually argon or krypton) between the glass layers. By adding a third layer of glass, you create two insulating gas pockets that significantly reduce heat conduction through the window. The increase in insulation is due to the combination of the gas and extra glass layer rather than just the gas alone. 2. Convection: heat also transfers through the movement of fluids, such as air. The two separate gas pockets created by triple glazing help reduce convective heat transfer, as gas is more stable and less prone to circulation than air. So, with an additional gas-filled space, triple-glazed windows further reduce heat loss or gain via convection. 3. Radiation: glass can absorb, reflect, and transmit radiant heat, which can be minimized by using special low-emissivity (low-e) coatings. Though not exclusive to triple glazing, using low-e coatings on each glass layer of a triple-glazed window can further diminish the transfer of radiant heat. An additional benefit of triple glazing is enhanced soundproofing. The extra layer of glass, combined with the gas pockets, helps dampen outdoor noise, providing a more comfortable indoor environment. In summary, while the gas layer in a multi-glazed window does play a significant role in insulation, adding an extra layer of glass (and thus an extra gas pocket) increases the overall insulation by reducing heat transfer via conduction, convection, and radiation. This makes triple-glazed windows even more effective at maintaining comfortable interior temperatures, ultimately increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy costs for homeowners.	"Neither gas nor glass is particularly good at insulating against thermal flow on its own. But the temperature exchange between the two is relatively slow, gas particles bumping into glass can only give or take some energy each time. Hence a good way to insulate is to have several changes between the two. Not counting the out- and inside of the window (they are less good at this due to wind/circulation), a double pane has 2 while a triple one has 4 changes of material; twice as good! If there weren't any convection, gas would often be a relatively good insulator. That's why some of the best insulators known are effectively lots of gas held in place by some finely structured material: from cotton, styrofoam and polyurethane foam up to aerogel. But such highly irregular materials are not transparent, but instead refract and reflect light around a lot between their chambers/pores; at best you get a milky, opaque look. The above stuff is beaten by not having the gas at all, that is, vacuum. That's what a highly insulating thermos flask (or the fancy industrial name: a dewar) does. But this requires quite good vacuum, the thermal conductivity of gas only decreases very slightly with pressure until a certain point. What matters is if it is likely (or not) that a gas molecule collides with another before it crosses the gap (and the width of the gap). Only at a vacuum quality where most cross without any collision is where the conductivity finally starts falling off. That's a few micrometers at normal pressure, you then need a millionth of an atmosphere for a reasonable flask! This effect also makes foams with extremely small (<1µm) pores better insulators. As it is often too difficult or just impossible to keep such a good vacuum for a long time (the flasks are effectively enclosed in steel walls), the latter is not always an option, leaving us again with multi-layered structures and ""foam""."

Every single roller coaster element is designed to ensure the ride has enough momentum to complete the course and return to the station. Every hill is smaller than the last. Every turn is wider and less banked than the last. Every brake section is at an elevation to allow the coaster to finish the remainder of the course following a dead stop. So when we see news articles about roller coasters not having enough momentum to clear a hill and getting stuck, I have absolutely no idea how this happens.	"Roller coasters are designed using precise calculations to ensure they have enough momentum to complete the course; however, external factors may cause them to ""valley"" or get stuck. Factors such as temperature, wind resistance, and changes in the coaster's weight (number of riders) can impact its performance, causing a loss of momentum. Additionally, maintenance issues, such as a worn wheel or a reduction in lubrication, can increase friction and slow the coaster down unexpectedly. While coaster designs are made to account for variations in these factors, there can be instances when the effects are greater than the tolerances accounted for, leading to the coaster getting stuck."	What happens on paper does not always happen in reality. Mathematically, it is not hard to design a roller coaster if you know what to calculate. You add up all the drops, subtract the climbs, and you can probably calculate the exact speed the thing will reach at any point in the track. However, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. There are many things in real life that you can't plan for perfectly. Sure, the engineers would take average friction and average rider weight into account, but sometimes things happen outside of average. Maybe this one ride has an abnormally light load, and maybe on this day the coaster is a week behind the greasing schedule. Because of this, the coaster gets stuck in a valley.

This has been on my mind right now, and I need some scientific explanation, please.	When you drop a feather inside a moving elevator, its falling speed depends on the elevator's motion. If the elevator moves upwards quickly, the feather will appear to fall faster relative to the elevator but not relative to an outside observer. This happens because the feather and the elevator's floor approach each other faster due to the elevator's upward motion.	If you drop it while the elevator is already moving at it's normal speed, it'll fall like normal because it was already moving with the elevator before you dropped itif you drop it while the elevator is stopped/going slow and then the elevator speeds up, then it'll drop faster because the elevator is moving towards it now

In a nutshell, stars cannot use iron in nuclear fusion because fusing iron consumes energy rather than releasing it, and stars need to release energy to maintain their stability. To elaborate, stars generate energy through a process called nuclear fusion. This process involves combining lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, to form heavier elements. When lighter elements fuse, they release energy in the form of light and heat. This energy output is what allows stars to counterbalance the force of gravity, which would otherwise cause them to collapse on themselves. However, when it comes to iron, the situation changes. Fusing iron requires more energy than is released during the process, making it energetically unfavorable. Unlike lighter elements, iron has a very stable nucleus, and breaking or fusing it demands a high amount of energy. When a star starts producing iron in its core, it signals the end of the star's life as it can no longer maintain its balance against gravity. The core collapses, eventually leading to a massive explosion called a supernova.	Iron have the lowest energy in its nucleus of all the elements. If you fuse hydrogen atoms into helium the resulting helium atom have less energy then the hydrogen atoms you started with so the rest of the energy is released into the star. As you fuse together elements up the periodic table you always end up with more energy left over until you get to iron. If you fuse iron and hydrogen for example the resulting cobalt require more energy to hold its nucleus together then the iron and hydrogen atom combined, so you need to put more energy into the fusion then you gain from it. It is still possible to do this, in fact that is how all the cobalt and other heavy elements are made. But it reduces the amount of energy in the star instead of increase it so this is a very short lived period in a stars life.

When we sneeze, our body moves forward because the force of the sneeze is directed outwards, and the reaction to that force pushes us slightly in the opposite direction. This can be explained using newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Imagine blowing up a balloon and then letting it go without tying the end; the air rushes out of the balloon, propelling it in the opposite direction. Similarly, when we sneeze, the force of the air expelled from our mouth and nose creates a small reaction force that moves our body forward, even if it's just a subtle movement.	The sneeze's forward movement and the sneeze's exhalation are actually the same thing; we move forward as we sneeze in order to create the strongest exhalation as possible by using as many muscles as possible. The diaphragm moves like normal breathing, but our backs, stomach, and shoulders curling in also shrinks the lung's area at the same time, making an even faster/stronger exhalation. It just so happens that the curling in looks like moving forward. After all, the air we expel might be moving very fast but its mass is so much less than any part of our body that it doesn't have the kinetic energy to move our head any noticeable amount.
647	57c0cad0-5141-45ff-8329-16cb1bbb6c1c.txt	Is light different in nature from other frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum? Let me rephrase the question - do we call the visible spectrum that because that's what we can see or is there something different about that part of electromagnetic spectrum (es) that allow vision to occur. Alternately, if light is dual in nature, being both a wave and a particle, is that the same for other parts of the es?	The visible spectrum is just a small portion of the entire electromagnetic spectrum (es), and it's labeled as such because it contains frequencies of light that our human eyes can detect. The electromagnetic spectrum, which includes a wide range of frequencies like radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, is characterized by the fact that all of these frequencies are both waves and particles, known as duality. This duality applies to the entire spectrum, not just visible light. What makes the visible spectrum special for us is that our eyes have evolved to detect a specific range of electromagnetic waves, which correspond to the wavelengths of visible light. The cells in our eyes called 'cones' contain pigments that absorb specific wavelengths of light and generate electrical signals that our brains interpret as colors. So, the reason we perceive the visible spectrum is due to the biology of our eyes and how they interact with those specific frequencies. In theory, it's possible for a creature to exist that can perceive frequencies from other parts of the es, as long as their eyes (or other sensing organs) have evolved to absorb and process those wavelengths. For example, some animals like bees can see ultraviolet light, which is outside of the visible spectrum for humans, while certain snakes can sense infrared light to track prey. So, while the visible spectrum is our eyes' ideal range for detecting light, other organisms may very well see the world differently by experiencing other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.	Yes, there are creatures that can see outside of the human visible spectrum, but not very far. Just a bit into the infrared and the ultraviolet. As for why we can detect those wavelengths, two main reasons. One, those wavelengths pass through water. As it is believed that life started in the ocean, the first eyes would only have been able to detect light that could penetrate into the ocean. Second, these wavelengths have the property that they can interact with small molecules. Infrared light and longer wavelengths are too big and weak to effect much, and mostly just scatter off our cells. Ultraviolet light and smaller wavelengths are too small and powerful, and will shoot right through our cells, mostly zipping right through but sometimes causing damage. The wavelengths in between, however, can be absorbed by the right kind of molecule, and the energy of that absorption can be used to send a signal that “hey, I just caught a photon! ” so yes, the visible range does have some special properties that make it suitable for use in vision. I have heard anecdotal tales of insects being affected by very long wavelengths, like the 120 hz signal from power lines, but I have not seen any scientific confirmation. It is possible that some creatures can detect wavelengths far from the visual spectrum in some way, but it wouldn’t be in the form of “vision. ”

When I drop my phone, shouldn't the force of impact be transferred to the phone itself since the case is in contact with the phone? Also how can the tempered glass protect my screen from cracks if its just a piece of plastic placed on top of my screen?	Phone covers and tempered glass protect your phone by absorbing and distributing the force of impact when your phone is dropped. While it's true that the case is in contact with your phone, the materials used in these protective accessories are designed to handle the shock and minimize the damage that reaches your device. To explain this, imagine jumping onto a soft mattress versus jumping onto a concrete floor. The mattress, being soft and compressible, would absorb the impact of your jump, while the hard concrete wouldn't absorb much of the impact, leading to potential injuries. Similarly, phone covers and tempered glass work as a cushion for your device. Phone covers are typically made of silicone, rubber, or a combination of materials that are designed to be flexible and shock-absorbent. When your phone hits the ground, the cover spreads out the force by deforming and bouncing back into shape, reducing the force that reaches the phone itself. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is designed to be strong and resistant to scratches. It's made by a process of heating and cooling the glass, making it much stronger than regular glass. When the tempered glass is installed, it acts as a buffer between your phone's screen and potential damage. If there's an impact, the tempered glass will take the brunt of it, and	When I drop my phone, shouldn't the force of impact be transferred to the phone itself since the case is in contact with the phone? Of course it does, but the extra mass of the case absorbs some of the impact first, and in the case of certain levels of force, will break the (relatively) inexpensive case rather than breaking the much more expensive screen. Also how can the tempered glass protect my screen from cracks if its just a piece of plastic placed on top of my screen? It isn't a piece of plastic; it's a thin layer of tempered glass. The idea is any impact which might potentially break your phone screen will break the tempered glass covering first, which takes energy - energy which is not then available to break your actual screen. Neither a case nor tempered glass will work all of the time - sometimes you drop your phone the wrong way - and neither will work on a strong enough impact, which will just break everything.

When pressure is applied to ice, such as when we step on it, the molecules of the ice near the surface can momentarily break their bonds and form water. This thin layer of water then makes the ice slippery. Additionally, when ice is in contact with an object like a shoe, it can slightly melt due to the heat generated by friction, creating an even more slippery surface. This combined effect of pressure and friction allows us to glide or slide effortlessly across the ice, like when we ice skate or slip on an icy sidewalk.	This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer. Scientists have long theorized that a thin layer of water, created by friction, accounts for the slipperiness of ice. But this raises questions, because water, on its own, is not nearly as slippery as ice. Only recently have scientists found a way to detect and analyze the layer of water on ice. They discovered that it is much thinner than expected, and also much more viscous. Indeed, it is as viscous as oil. More work needs to be done to determine the reason for this thin layer of water being so viscous. But one theory is that it’s not pure water, but a mix of water and ice particles.

Because photons have no mass, they don't need a force to move. The absence of mass allows them to travel at the fastest speed possible, which is the speed of light. This speed is a fundamental property of the universe. When a photon is created, it instantly starts moving at the speed of light due to the nature of electromagnetic waves. These waves are created when electric and magnetic fields interact, causing the energy to propagate in a self-sustaining cycle, which is how light travels.	"There's no real ""force"" involved. Forces accelerate and decelerate things. Massless particles just kind of... Travel at the speed of light. Mass comes from interaction with something called the higgs field, so you could sort of think of the higgs field as being the thing that *prevents* things from going at *c*. Things without mass don't interact with this field, so they just... Travel at *c*. (note: light *can* travel slower depending on the material it's travelling through, but you can't grab it and slow it down like you could with, say, a cannonball)"

Freezer burn happens when food loses moisture due to cold air exposure, causing dehydration and oxidation. This is a result of air making contact with food surfaces, leading to dried-out patches and off flavors. Different freezing methods affect how susceptible food is to freezer burn. For example, vacuum-sealing or wrapping food tightly in plastic wrap reduces air exposure and slows down the freezer burn process. Also, maintaining a consistent freezer temperature and not storing food for too long can help prevent freezer burn.	It's the removal of water. More accurately put your food is 'freezer dehydrated' not burned. The freezer pulls moisture out of the air like any compressor or air conditioner does. Evaporates water out of anything you put inside whether vegetables or chicken moisture leaves it eventually. Unsealed is worse, while ice crystals can be trapped and reform inside bags or on exterior of food like condensation. If you leave icecubes in freezer too long they shrink and dissapear evaporate away too. Edit it is mostly sublimation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sublimation_(phase_transition) not evaporation

So, basically we have rim brakes that usually uses some kind of rubber against the rim, so they have a lot of friction plus they are further than the centre of the wheel, then leverage is a lot. Then we have disc brakes that honestly don't know which material is against the steel, but the leverage is way less than rim. What is the explanation of it's stopping power?	Bike disc brakes are more efficient than rim brakes due to increased braking force and better heat dissipation. Let me break it down to make it easier to understand. 1. Increased braking force: disc brakes have a smaller radius compared to rim brakes, which means they require a higher force to achieve the same stopping power. This is where the brake calipers and pads come into play. The calipers in disc brakes are designed to provide a stronger clamping force on a smaller surface area (the disc), resulting in a greater ability to stop the bike. Moreover, the materials used in disc brake pads, typically metallic or ceramic, offer better performance and wear less than rubber rim brake pads. 2. Better heat dissipation: when brakes are applied, they generate heat due to friction. Rim brakes dissipate this heat through the bike's rim, which is not an optimal place since the heat can negatively affect the tire and inner tube. Disc brakes, on the other hand, dissipate heat through the metal disc, which is separate from the wheel. This allows for more efficient heat management and prevents potential damage to the tire. To sum up, disc brakes offer increased stopping power and better heat management compared to rim brakes, making them a more efficient option for cyclists.	For several reasons:1. Bike wheel rims get dirty and wet when riding (especially off road). A dirty wet rim doesn't work as a friction surface very well. Because discs are near the hub, they avoid most of the spashback and remain cleaner. 2. Bike wheel rims are made of thin aluminum. You can't press too hard on a wheel rim or it will bend or tear. Brake discs are made of thick steel, and can withstand a lot higher loads without breaking. 3. Because of the steel disk, you can use a more aggressive brake pad. Rim brakes have rubber friction pads, while disc brakes have ceramic pads which create a lot more friction. Using ceramic pads on a rim would quickly destroy the delicate aluminum. Rim breaking actually has a mechanical advantage, being closer to outside of the wheel gives it a longer moment arm and more stopping power for the same applied friction force. But the fact that rims are so delicate means you can't use very much friction force, while a disc brake can withstand much higher load. S

At roughly 2000 C, [propane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_burner) burns [blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_burner#/media/file:propane-burner. Jpg). At 3551 C, [mu cephei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mu_cephei) earned the name ""herschel's garnet star"", and this is not a reference to uvarovite."	Flames colors are far more dependent upon their composition than their temperature. There's no green hot but if you add copper sulfate to a fire its gonna be very greenthe color you seem from flames at non-astronomical temperature (<3000 c) isn't determined by blackbody radiation but instead by the electrons of the exhaust hopping between fixed levels. As you add more energy, the co2 in the smoke hops between higher energy levels causing it to give off higher frequency (bluer) photonsstars on the other hand have a photosphere(the part that actually emits light) that is at crazy high temperatures which cause it to emit enough blackbody radiation in the visible spectrum to actually be visible. As you crank the temperature of stars up it again shifts the main spike towards bluer wavelengths so you get red, yellow, white, then blue stars.	"Red stars appear red because of the way they emit light, which is related to their temperature. The color of a star's light depends on its surface temperature, following a principle known as ""blackbody radiation. "" stars behave like near-perfect blackbodies, meaning they emit a continuous spectrum of light across various wavelengths. The spectrum of light emitted by a star peaks at a specific wavelength, which is determined by its temperature. This peak wavelength follows wien's law, which basically states that hotter objects emit light with shorter wavelengths, while cooler objects emit light with longer wavelengths. In the context of stars, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. As a result, red stars actually have lower surface temperatures than blue ones. So, while red stars like mu cephei may seem counterintuitively cooler than a blue propane flame, the color difference simply reflects their different surface temperatures and the way they emit light."

With the half life of the radioactive metals used in the fuel rods being thousands of years, the fuel used in reactors, I would think, should last for similar amounts of time. How come nuclear plants go through large amount of spent fuel that then has to be stored?	"You're comparing natural decay with induced fission. In ambient conditions, radioactive elements with unstable atomic structure are basically falling apart slowly. In turn, they only released a small amount of energy as they do so. With fission, you speed up the process by shooting a bunch neutrons at the radioactive atoms so they fall apart much, much faster. So much faster that neutrons in the radioactive atoms explode out, hit other atoms and cause them to break apart too. If the effect is strong enough, you get a chain reaction that produces a lot of energy (but also causes all your radioactive fuel to ""fall apart"" faster). Natural decay is a rickety building falling apart slowly over years or decades into rubble. Fission is when you topple that rickety building so that it hits the rickety building beside it, which then also tips over and hits another building, and another, etc. Domino effect."	"Nuclear fuel gets spent relatively quickly because it's not the half-life of the radioactive metals that determines the fuel's usability, but rather the concentration of fissile isotopes like uranium-235. These isotopes are responsible for sustaining the chain reaction to generate energy. When a nuclear reactor is operating, uranium-235 in the fuel rods undergoes fission, producing energy and splitting into smaller elements called fission products. As the reaction continues, more uranium-235 gets used up, and the concentration of fission products increases. Eventually, there's not enough uranium-235 left to sustain a chain reaction, and the fuel becomes ""spent. ""it's like using a box of matches where most matches don't burn well. Initially, there are enough good matches to keep the fire going. But as you use more and more good matches, eventually there won't be enough to maintain the fire, and you'll need a new box of matches. In a nuclear reactor, that's when the fuel rods are replaced and stored as spent fuel."

Like if a car starts at rest and moves at 4m/s^2 for 10seconds, what does that mean?	"Acceleration is the rate at which an object's speed changes over time. In other words, it's how much faster the object is going every second. ""seconds squared"" or ""seconds per second"" represents this rate of change. For example, a car accelerating at 4m/s^2 for 10 seconds means that every second, the car's speed increases by 4 meters per second. After 10 seconds, the car would be moving at 40m/s, because its speed increased by 4m/s every second for those 10 seconds."	"Don't think of ""meters"" per ""second per second"".

The main difference between convection cooking in an oven and an air fryer is the size and intensity of the air circulation. Both methods use fans to circulate hot air, but air fryers have a smaller cooking space and more powerful fans. This results in faster, more even cooking and a crispier outer layer, mimicking the effect of deep frying with less oil. Convection ovens, though also circulating air, have a larger space and slower air circulation, making them better suited for general baking and roasting.	Conceptually the do the same thing as a convection oven, but in practice air friers are faster because they blow more air directly to the food (rather than sideways in a convection oven) and have a smaller volume that heats up quicker also the form factor changes, while an oven has a front door, air friers have a slide out tray that makes it easier and more convenient to load and take things out to serve them

When a nuclear weapon detonates, it generates a lot of radiation, specifically high-energy gamma rays. Those rays can energize electrons in the upper atmosphere, which create electric currents. These energized electrons are simultaneously subject to the earth's magnetic field (due to them being energized) and are thus trapped in place all at once, meaning that the electric currents are generated simultaneously, rather than being spread out over a period of time as different electrons get energized and/or move. This massive, uniform current in turn creates a rapidly growing electric field, which is called an electromagnetic pulse.	Nuclear warheads create electromagnetic pulses (EMPS) when detonated in space due to the interaction of the explosion's radiation with earth's atmosphere. The explosion releases gamma rays that collide with air molecules, knocking off electrons. This process, called ionization, creates an electric field that accelerates these free electrons. As they move rapidly, they produce a strong electromagnetic pulse. This emp can damage or destroy electronics and electrical systems on earth by inducing high voltages and currents, similar to a sudden, powerful surge of electricity.

A bullet shot upwards fights gravity more than one shot horizontally. When a bullet is fired horizontally, gravity mainly affects its vertical motion, causing it to fall towards the ground. However, when it's shot upwards, gravity works directly against its motion, slowing it down as it goes up and eventually stops its ascent. In both cases, gravity is present, but the upward shot experiences a greater impact from gravitational force due to the opposing direction of motion.	Both bullets would feel the exact same effects of gravity as soon as they are fired. Both bullets experience a downwards acceleration of 9. 81m/s^2 due to gravity, however the bullet fired upward will feel this effect for longer as it will be in the air longer. Fun fact: if you fired a bullet straight, and dropped an unfired bullet from your hand at the same instant, both bullets hit the ground at the same time!

The main difference between an extremely thick liquid and a solid is how their particles behave. In a solid, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place, maintaining a fixed shape. In a thick liquid, particles are looser and can flow slowly, taking the shape of their container. The difference becomes less relevant when the substance is close to its transition point, like glass that can exhibit properties of both solid and liquid. It matters less in certain applications, such as using thick liquids for casting molds or solid-like materials in construction.	The pitch in the university of queensland pitch drop experiment (Google it, it's really interesting) is liquid, but there is about a decade between each drop falling. Glass on the other hand is solid, despite the myth that really old windows are thicker at the base because they've flowed (they were just made that way back then). The biggest difference is that if you put increasing stress on the pitch, it'd flow faster, but glass wouldn't flow at all as long as it could withstand the forces.

I don't really understand the definitions provided on Google.	Time crystals are unique structures that exhibit time-based repeating patterns in their atomic arrangement. Unlike traditional crystals, which have repeating patterns in physical space, time crystals have repeating patterns in time, and this behavior is called temporal periodicity. To understand this concept, think of a traditional crystal, like salt, which has a repeating lattice of atoms in a fixed structure. This is spatial periodicity - the atomic pattern is continuous and stable in space. Time crystals, on the other hand, have their atoms organized in a way that they return to their initial arrangement after a specific time interval, creating a cycle of changing configurations. The idea of time crystals was first proposed by nobel laureate frank wilczek in 2012. At first, they were considered impossible because they seemed to violate the laws of thermodynamics. However, researchers have since created them in the lab using specially designed systems. In these experiments, they used trapped ions, which are charged atoms, and manipulated their properties using laser pulses. By controlling the interactions between these ions, the researchers managed to create time crystals exhibiting temporal periodicity. Overall, time crystals represent a new state of matter characterized by their unique time-based repeating atomic pattern. While this concept may sound quite abstract, it has potential applications in quantum computing and other emerging technologies, where maintaining the stability of systems over time is crucial.	"If you take a normal crystal, (eg, salt), an freeze it all the way down to ""absolute zero"", then the particles in the crystal won't be moving. However, they have a regular structure horizontally and vertically - in space. If you move in space along the crystal, there's a regular pattern. But in time, it's constant. (that's only at absolute zero though - at higher temperatures. The atoms are jiggling randomly, within the confines of their ""spot"" in the crystal. Random jiggling doesn't count here. )a ""time crystal"" is different. When you freeze it to absolute zero, you find the atoms are *still moving*. They'll be wobbling back and forth in a perfectly regular pattern. So they not only have a regular pattern in space, but in time also. You might think that this means there's still some heat that could be removed - after all, if they're moving, doesn't that mean they have kinetic energy, and so the temperature isn't 0? But the normal ""high school"" definition of temperature doesn't actually work well near absolute zero, and these ""time crystals"" really have no energy left to remove. To stop the vibration of the atoms, you'd have to actually add energy, if it was possible at all."

So if they are blocked by lead, where do they go? Does they build up in the lead and gradually turn it radioactive?	When lead or other shielding materials absorb radiation, the subatomic particles (like alpha or beta particles) or high-energy photons (like gamma rays) interact with the atoms in the shielding. This interaction can cause electrons to be knocked out of the atoms or transfer energy to them. The shielding then re-emits the energy as less harmful radiation or heat. This process doesn't typically lead to the buildup of radioactivity in the shielding material. However, in some cases like neutron radiation, certain materials may become temporarily radioactive through a process called neutron activation.	The danger from radioactive particles comes from the energy they carry, not the particles themselves. A high-energy particle zipping through the body can easily break molecular bonds, destroying all sorts of structures needed to keep us alive and functioning properly. A lower energy particle is much less capable of doing significant damage. Radioactive particles are high energy, and lead is so dense that the particles keep colliding with lead nuclei, and each collision dissipates energy until the particle isn't energetic enough to do any damage. So the particles don't go anywhere, they just fizzle out.
662	4416b5b7-8ffc-4ccc-a471-55fdca432a2c.txt	Why are magnet trains faster than normal trains?	Three reasons. One is friction, while there's not a lot of friction between the wheels and the rails, there is some. There's also friction on the bearing of the wheels etc. A maglev floats above the rail. Second is that the maglev is powered by being pushed by the magnets in the rail. You can push something really hard with magnets. It's more difficult to do the same with steel wheels on steel rails. The same goes for slowing down. It's easier to reverse the magnets than stop steel on steel from sliding. Three is aerodynamics. At high speeds, having a smoother shape matters a lot. You might not think that the wheels will add drag, but they do. Bonus reason is that it's significantly more difficult for a maglev to derail, which at high speeds is rather welcome. Fortunately that doesn't seem to have come up yet as a problem for traditional high speed trains. Wheeled trains can go faster. It's just too difficult, expensive and dangerous to do so. That bar is raised with maglev. They can go faster because it's easier and safer than trying to get a wheeled train up to the same speed.	Magnet trains, also known as maglev trains, are faster than normal trains because they use a different technology that eliminates friction between the train and the tracks. By doing so, they can achieve higher speeds more efficiently while also providing a smoother, quieter ride. In a conventional train, the wheels are in direct contact with the tracks, which creates friction as the train moves. This friction limits the train's top speed and requires more energy to overcome. Additionally, this friction can lead to wear and tear on the wheels and tracks, requiring maintenance and potentially causing noise and vibrations. Maglev trains, on the other hand, use powerful magnets to levitate the train above the tracks. One set of magnets on the train is repelled by a corresponding set on the tracks, which lifts the train up and keeps it suspended in midair. Another set of magnets arranged along the tracks propels the train forward by attracting the front of the train and repelling the rear. This setup eliminates the friction between the train and the tracks, allowing maglev trains to reach much higher speeds than conventional trains – up to 375 mph (600 km/h) compared to around 186 mph (300 km/h) for high-speed traditional trains. In summary, maglev trains are faster than normal trains because they use magnetic levitation to eliminate the friction that slows down traditional trains riding on tracks, which allows for much higher speeds and greater efficiency.

Storing electricity using electrons moving in circles is impractical due to a phenomenon called resistance. In simple terms, resistance is when materials oppose the flow of electrons, generating heat and losing energy. Imagine rubbing your hands together - they get warm due to friction, right? Similarly, when electrons move through wires, they encounter resistance, causing energy loss as heat. To store electricity efficiently, minimal energy loss is crucial. That's why we use methods like batteries, which store energy chemically and release it when needed, with less energy wasted in the process.	We can! That's what inductive coils do. The problem is resistance, the electrons moving in circles will lose energy due to friction and slow down. You can prevent that using superconducting coils, but those are extremely expensive and only work at extremely low temperatures. (wich means you have to spend energy to keep them cold)overall it's an inefficient way of storing energy (because you have to spend energy every second you store it). Batteries do a better job for longterm storage (everything that is multiple seconds is longterm in this case)

How does that work?	The device uses an infrared sensor to detect IR radiation coming from the surface being measured (all hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation - infrared is typical of the temperature ranges we'd be measuring, but if something is hot enough it will emit radiation in the visible light range. You'll have seen this when something gets red-hot or white-hot, for example). The laser is just for targeting, and plays no role in the actual measurement.	Laser thermometers, also called infrared thermometers, work by measuring the infrared radiation emitted by an object. All objects emit infrared radiation as a form of heat, with hotter objects emitting more. The thermometer's sensor detects this radiation and converts it into a temperature reading. The laser beam you see only helps to aim the thermometer; it doesn't measure the temperature itself. This allows you to check the temperature of a pan or water without touching it, avoiding potential burns.
665	12642f5f-26bd-401f-a4b5-b1ef4d8bd5b5.txt	What is the purpose of horseshoe shaped magnets? All my life I've seen them in cartoons, comics, there is an emoji with one, but I've never actually seen one. Not even in classrooms when we did things with magnets, or in other scientific applications.	"The main purpose of horseshoe-shaped magnets, also known as U-shaped magnets, is to provide a strong magnetic field in a concentrated area. This is achieved by bringing the two poles of the magnet – the north and south poles – close together. In a bar magnet, the magnetic field lines run from one end of the magnet (north pole) to the other end (south pole). In a horseshoe magnet, the magnetic poles are bent toward each other, making the distance between them shorter. This results in a stronger and more concentrated magnetic field between the poles, which in turn allows the magnet to attract and hold objects more effectively. A great analogy to understand this is to think of a water hose. When you turn on the faucet, water comes out of the hose in a stream. If you want to increase the water pressure, you could either increase the force from the source, or you could bend the hose to direct the flow into a smaller area. Similarly, horseshoe magnets ""direct"" the magnetic field into a small area by bending the poles towards each other, thereby creating a stronger magnetic force. Horseshoe magnets are commonly used in various applications like magnetic door latches, small motors, loudspeakers, as well as in the field of education to demonstrate the principles of magnetism. They may not be as commonly seen these days due to the development of stronger and more compact magnets made from materials such as neodymium, which don't require the horseshoe shape to achieve a strong magnetic field. In summary, horseshoe-shaped magnets are designed to create a stronger magnetic field in a concentrated area by bringing the two poles of the magnet close together. This makes them more effective at attracting and holding objects compared to straight bar magnets."	"Once upon a time we had far fewer choices in how to make magnets and what to make them out of. In the simplest case a bar of iron held in a strong magnetic field will eventually become a magnet, and this happens faster if you heat it. Now you have a bar magnet, but if you want to use it for lifting an iron object half the magnetic pull is at the other end and useless. Bend the bar into a u-shape and you can put both magnetic poles on whatever you're trying to lift. Of course, bending it is hard, and if you heat it or hammer it you can lose some of the atomic alignment that creates the magnetic field. So people got clever put two electromagnetic coils side by side. Heat an iron bar, bend it in a u, put the iron horseshoe in the two coils, turn them on, let it cool, you have a magnet with both magnetic poles facing the same way and useful. (yes, it's sort of two magnets in the same piece of iron but the magnetic ""lines of force"" can flow easily through the iron so they sort of reinforce each other. )then we started putting aluminum, nickel, and copper into ""alnico"" magnets which were much stronger, and the u shape became superfluous. Cheaper were ceramic magnets with lots of iron in them, and nowadays we have these rare earth magnets that are spookily powerful to those of us who grew up with the old kind. Short answer, the u shape was the best way to make stronger magnets with low technology."

Does this mean literally flat, like a sheet of paper, or does it have a different meaning here? When we look at the sky, it seems like there are stars in all directions- up, down, and around.	"In the context of the universe, ""flat"" doesn't mean two-dimensional like a sheet of paper, but rather it refers to the geometry of space itself. Imagine you're drawing shapes on a flat piece of paper, a balloon, and a saddle. Depending on the curvature of the surface you draw on, the properties of the shapes can change. In the case of the universe, being ""flat"" means that it follows euclidean geometry – the geometry most of us learn in school. When scientists talk about the flatness of the universe, they actually mean that the overall shape of the universe obeys the rules of euclidean or ""flat"" geometry on large scales. If you draw a triangle in the universe, the angles would add up to 180 degrees, just like on a flat piece of paper. The reason stars seem to be in all directions is because the universe is both massive and expanding. Even though the universe follows flat geometry on large scales, its matter is distributed unevenly, which is why we observe stars and galaxies in various directions."	With your sheet of paper, it's flat because you can draw parallel lines on it, and they stay parallel as far as you can extend them. If you wrapped the paper around a cylinder, it would still be flat. _but_ if you wrapped it around a sphere, then it would not. You could get lines that start parallel, but then meet each other - like lines of longitude at the poles. The universe appears to be flat and 3d. As far as we can tell, parallel lines can extend as far as you like and remain parallel. However we don't know if that's true at very large scales, or if that's the only way that a universe could be. It's a bit hard to imagine what a non-flat 3d space would look like, but if could do things like wrapping around so if you travel far enough in one dimension you get back to your starting place, or expanding out 'too fast' so there's more distant space than normal geometry would suggest.

Think of glass that's sandblasted and now scatters light instead of letting it pass through. It turns opaque white. Think of tiny, fine foam bubbles that bounce light in every direction, they're white too, even if each bubble is clear on it's own. Clouds are full of tiny water molecules that scatter light, so they're white. Snow bounces light in every direction so it's white.	Snow appears white because it reflects all the colors of light. When light enters a transparent medium, like water or ice, it slows down and its different color wavelengths can be scattered or absorbed. Snow is made up of many ice crystals and as light passes through these, it gets scattered and re-emitted in various directions. Since snow crystals scatter all color wavelengths equally, they blend together and create the color white, which our eyes perceive as snow's color.
668	9bb097e7-6cd6-4106-a4ad-7e1c79e7effc.txt	Why can you not detect the change in direction in a space station orbiting the earth? The space station would be constantly changing its direction to go around earth, unlike if it were just to fall straight down.	On a space station orbiting the earth, you don't feel the change in direction because both the station and its occupants are in a state of freefall, constantly falling towards earth while also moving forward with enough speed to avoid crashing into it. This delicate balance creates an illusion of weightlessness. Imagine you're inside a car turning at high speed; you'll feel yourself being pushed against the side because the car's structure provides a force to change your direction. However, in an orbiting space station, both you and the station are falling simultaneously and there is no external force pushing against you. A helpful analogy is that of a coin spinning around the inside of a funnel. As the coin spirals down, it's both falling towards the center and moving forward. If you were a tiny person on that coin, it would feel like you were in freefall, and you wouldn't notice the changes in direction. In summary, you don't feel the direction change on a space station because everything inside is in freefall, falling towards earth while also moving forward at a speed that maintains the orbit, creating an experience of weightlessness without any forces acting on you that would make you aware of the motion.	"You're imagining what being in a turning vehicle on earth would feel like, getting pushed to the outside, right? Orbit isn't like that. Here's the difference:things in orbit **are** falling straight down. They're just *also* going sideways at a constant speed fast enough that they're continually missing the planet and falling past it. This means that things in orbit are not ""turning"". They're freefalling, and not undergoing any acceleration in the reference frame of the station and everything in it. So it's not like when you're in a car that actively turns and you feel the inertia of your body wanting to continue in a straight path. The space station is just free-falling, plus a constant forward speed to avoid the ground - but you can never detect constant speed inside any vehicle, only acceleration. Once you dock on and enter the station, you're just free-falling too. All the contents is free-falling along with the station. There's no change in trajectory, so you don't feel it because there's nothing to feel."
669	8672ac60-1dc2-4667-97ae-507eb34ba1b3.txt	Why is ° (degree) put before Farenheit and Celsius but not before Kelvin?	The main reason why the degree symbol (°) is used before Fahrenheit (°f) and Celsius (°c) but not before Kelvin (k) is because kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, whereas fahrenheit and celsius are relative temperature scales. Fahrenheit and celsius use a degree symbol because their scales are based on arbitrary reference points. In the celsius scale, 0°c is the freezing point of water, and 100°c is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. In the fahrenheit scale, 32°f is the freezing point of water, and 212°f is the boiling point of water at the same pressure. On the other hand, the kelvin scale starts at 0k, known as absolute zero, which represents the lowest possible temperature in the universe where all molecular motion stops. It is an absolute scale because it directly measures the kinetic energy of particles without any arbitrary reference points. Consequently, we use the symbol k without the degree symbol to represent kelvin, emphasizing its unique nature as an absolute temperature scale.	"It's because Kelvin is a unit but the others are degrees. A degree is a change in temperature that is measured against a scale (two most well known are Celsius and Fahrenheit scales). A change in degrees on either scale just means that the temperature changed, but doesn't say much about the actual energy for it. But to be a unit, it must satisfy two criteria: at zero units, there is none; and when the unit is doubled, it needs to be twice as much of whatever is being measured. With kelvin, you are measuring heat through the energy contained in a molecule. At 0k, aka absolute zero, there is no energy. And if you were to go from 100k to 200k, the thermal energy is doubled. Also it used to be referred to as ""degrees kelvin,"" but was changed in the mid-to-late 1960s to just ""kelvins"" (lowercase and plural of more than one)."

For example in top gun maverick when they have to do the high climb, or in interstellar in the docking scene what's happening to their bodies. Also what is the difference between positive and negative G's?"	G-force is the push/pull effect on your body relative to the natural gravitational pull on your body. Positive G-force is acceleration of your body against gravity's pull - think about being on a roller coaster going uphill really fast. This is the feeling that your stomach is still at the bottom of the hill but your body is going up. Negative Gs is the opposite - your body is falling faster then the natural gravitational pull. Now you are at the top of the roller coaster going down - the feeling that your stomach is still at the top while you are moving down rapidly. The reason this is critical to monitor for pilots and such, as they point out in top gun, is that excessive G forces can cause your blood pressure to drop and your brain to lose oxygen from lack of blood flow. The blood pressure drops, because the pull is so strong that the blood cannot flow properly.	"Pulling G's, or experiencing G-forces, refers to the force of gravity experienced by a person or object when it undergoes acceleration. It is called ""pulling G's"" because it feels like gravity is pulling, or pushing, on you more than usual. For example, in top gun maverick, when pilots rapidly climb, their bodies experience additional g-forces because they need to overcome the gravitational pull of earth's surface while also quickly changing their altitude. Positive g-forces apply a downward pressure on the body. Imagine going up a steep hill on a roller coaster. When you reach the top, you feel heavier because more G'S are pushing down on you. Negative G-forces apply an upward pressure, like when you go down that steep hill on a roller coaster, and you feel lighter or weightless. Both positive and negative G-forces can cause physical strain, but positive G's are generally considered more uncomfortable because they can cause blood to pool in the lower body, making it harder for the heart to pump oxygen-rich blood to the brain — which is necessary for maintaining consciousness."

Instead of explaining to my daughter that santa does not exist, I decided to tell her that the sun is not actually yellow plus a bunch of unnecessary explanations about the emitting spectrums of light and ended up in a circle of questions from which there is no escape 2nd day. I know the complex scientific explanation, but can someone help me explain it to my *almost* 5-year-old daughter?	The sun appears white because it emits all colors of light, including green, but when they mix together, they create white light. When sunlight passes through earth's atmosphere, the blue and green light scatter, making the sky look blue and the sun appear more yellow. So, the sun emits green light, but it's part of the whole white light.	Your eyes don’t scale every wavelength of light evenly. We evolved under the sun’s green-peak spectrum and equalize that out in our brains by amplifying reds and blues and muting yellows. An alien might insist that *their* star is white and ours is visibly green, having evolved to balance the light of a different star.

I understand that all on the surface is likely small in comparison the earth whole mass, but if all that is created and all which disappears is just a renewal of the same elements. Is earth’s weight a constant?	"No, earth's weight is not constant. Every time you see a ""shooting star"", that's a meteor(ite? ) that's burning up on entering earth's atmosphere, which adds mass to the earth. At the same time, many of the very light gases, like helium, that are present in the earth's atmosphere can be lost to space due to electromagnetic ""winds"". Earth's mass is never constant."	Earth's weight is not constant; it changes over time due to a few factors. Two main contributors are space debris (meteorites) adding mass, and earth losing mass by releasing gases (hydrogen and helium) into space. Overall, earth gains more mass than it loses, making it slightly heavier over time. However, this change is relatively minor compared to earth's total mass.

I've heard the recent breakthrough in fusion energy allows you to ""create"" more energy than what was put in. How does this work? Shouldn't it be impossible?"	"Fusion ignition doesn't violate the conservation of energy because it converts mass into energy, following einstein's famous equation, e=mc². In a fusion reaction, light atomic nuclei, like hydrogen, combine to form heavier nuclei, like helium. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy, which is the result of a small amount of mass being converted into energy. So, you're not ""creating"" energy, but rather converting mass into energy in an efficient way."	The same way a campfire puts out more heat than the match that starts it. It burns fuel. In this case fusion fuel is lighter elements like hydrogen and helium that when consumed turn into heavier elements. The energy input talked about is readily usable energy from electricity needed to start and maintain the reaction. It isn't talking about the energy input from the fusion fuel.

"Space can be ""cold"" for humans because, although it is a vacuum with few molecules to transfer heat, the way our bodies lose heat is different in space compared to earth's atmosphere. On earth, we primarily lose body heat through conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction and convection involve directly transferring heat to nearby molecules, such as air or water. Since space is a vacuum with few molecules, conduction and convection aren't significant factors. However, radiation is how we lose heat in space. Radiation involves the emission of electromagnetic waves, like infrared waves, which are emitted by all objects with a temperature. In space, our bodies constantly emit infrared radiation, but there is no air or other material to absorb this radiation and warm us back up. This means our bodies lose heat continuously without a compensating heat source to maintain our temperature. For example, imagine lying on the ground on a cold day with a blanket. The blanket traps some of the heat radiating from your body, keeping you warmer. In space, this ""blanket"" is absent, so our bodies continuously radiate away heat without anything to trap it, making space feel cold for humans."	"Space isn't really either cold or hot. Space is a vacuum and vacuum is a thermal insulatorlike a vacuum flask that keeps hot drinks hot in the winter and cold drinks cold in the summer, the vacuum of space keeps things the temperature they are at, by cutting of the main way that things normally get warmer or colder. Things in space still lose heat by radiating it away as infrared light and may gain heat by being exposed to radiation from the sun, but they don't gain or lose any heat the main normal way we do down here. Since machines and people create heat when working it may often by the case that spacecraft have a problem cooling down and may get to warm unless they manage to radiate heat away enough. Of course that is only for enclosed things like space stations, space craft of people in space-suits. A person without a space suit will experience all sort of other weird effects as they die. Fluids exposed to space at zero atmospheric pressure will not remain fluids and end up doing things to the body. The ""cold"" of space will be your least problem in any case."

"Quantum physics is super hard to eli5 and especially the concept of spin because it doesn't really have any equivalent in classic physics that we can analogize to. The main thing to know is what spin is not. Spin in this case is *not* a measure of actual particles as little balls spinning around an axis - that's not how particles work. Spin is a measure of a particle's intrinsic angular momentum, so it has *some* similarities to what we think of as spin, but it's not really same. I'm going to borrow an explanation by stephen hawking here:""what the spin of a particle really tells us is what the particle looks like from different directions. A particle of spin 0 is like a dot: it looks the same from every direction. On the other hand, a particle of spin 1 is like an arrow: it looks different from different directions. Only if one turns it round a complete revolution (360 degrees) does the particle look the same. A particle of spin 2 is like a double-headed arrow: it looks the same if one turns it round half a revolution (180 degrees). Similarly, higher spin particles look the same if one turns them through smaller fractions of a complete revolution. ""i don't know if any of this helped at all."	"Particle ""spin"" is a fundamental property of subatomic particles, similar to how mass and charge are properties of matter. Spin is a measurement of a particle's intrinsic angular momentum, which is a fancy way of saying the particle's inherent ""twist"" or ""rotation"" that doesn't depend on external forces. Now, the concept of spin can be a bit confusing because it isn't like the spinning we observe in everyday life. An electron, for example, doesn't actually spin like a top. Instead, spin is a quantum mechanical property that is better thought of as a label or characteristic of the particle. The values of spin, like 1/2 or 1, are related to how the particle's properties behave under certain transformations. To understand this, consider an object that is spinning in space. If it completes one full rotation (360 degrees), it will look the same as before. Particles with a spin of 1 are similar; they ""return to their original state"" after a full rotation. However, particles with a spin of 1/2, such as electrons, need to rotate twice (720 degrees) to return to their original state. This may seem strange, but it's because we're dealing with abstract mathematical properties rather than physical spinning. In summary, particle spin is a property of subatomic particles that acts as a label representing inherent angular momentum. The values of spin, like 1/2 and 1, are tied to the particle's behavior under rotations, and these values are essential in understanding the properties and interactions of particles at the quantum level."

My high school chemistry teacher said that there is no such thing as a “vacuum,” it’s just a difference in air pressure. But you always hear about the “vacuum” of space, or when something is “vacuum-sealed. ” I am not scientifically inclined, so I don’t even know where to begin. Im also not sure if “physics” is the correct flair lol. I was wondering if it could be explained from either side of the argument.	"A vacuum, in scientific terms, refers to a space with little or no matter and very low air pressure. It's nearly impossible to create a perfect vacuum, as there are always some particles present. The ""vacuum of space"" or ""vacuum-sealed"" products refer to very low-pressure environments, not a complete absence of matter. So, your teacher is partly right; vacuums exist, but they're just places with significantly reduced air pressure and particles."	Vacuum is just a term we use to describe an area that has relatively low pressure or near-zero pressure. Vacuums exist as a lack of pressure in exactly the same way that cold exists as a lack of heat—it’s not a thing unto itself, but it is a useful concept for discussion purposes. That’s probably what your teacher was trying to convey, but if so they did a poor job of communicating it.

If you find a way to introduce photons inside a ball of perfect mirrors, like you teleport them in or something, and there's a perfect vacuum inside the ball, they'll bounce around forever. That's because the light inside will behave as a gas, called photon gas ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/photon\_gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/photon_gas)) and has pressure, temperature, the whole shebang. The added weight equals the energy of the photons, which will be very little. But its weight will defo increase. I swear I'm not... gaslighting you. If you keep teleporting light in it, the temperature and pressure will increase until it reaches the melting point (or the breaking point, whichever first) of the material the ball is made of. Then it'll crack and release the light inside all at once, which should be quite a flash. Since we're already in wonderland, with the perfect mirrors and perfect vacuum and teleporting light, we could add that the ball never melts and is unbreakable and perfectly insulating. Then you can keep teleporting light in it, and you'll start noticing it gets noticeably heavier. You can't do that indefinitely though. At some point, it'll turn into a black hole.	When you shine a light inside a perfect mirror ball, you create an infinite number of reflections bouncing around inside the sphere. The basic concept here is reflection, where light bounces off surfaces like mirrors at the same angle it hits them. Imagine you're holding a flashlight and pointing it at a flat mirror. The light reflects off the mirror at the same angle it comes in. Now, let's take that concept and apply it to a perfect mirror ball. The mirror ball has a curved surface, which means that light rays will bounce off at different angles, creating more reflections. Since the inside of the ball is also mirrored, those reflected rays will bounce off again, creating even more reflections. Now, in an ideal situation, where the ball is a perfect mirror and there's no loss of light (no absorption or scattering), these reflections would continue indefinitely, creating an intricate pattern of light inside the ball. In reality, though, no mirror is perfect, and some light will be absorbed or scattered, eventually fading away. However, if you were to look inside such a ball, you'd see a dazzling display of light, with seemingly countless reflections creating a mesmerizing effect.

Snow appears white because it has air pockets trapped inside it that scatter all light roughly equally. But squeeze snow enough, and you'll see that the resulting [ice is quite blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_ice_(glacial\)). The same is true of large quantities of snow, you just don't normally notice that.	Snow holes appear blue because of the way light interacts with the snow. As sunlight enters, it gets scattered and absorbed by the snow's ice crystals. Red wavelengths get absorbed first, leaving primarily blue light to travel deeper. The deeper the hole, the more red light is absorbed, making the remaining blue light even more apparent.

The snow used to build an igloo acts as a natural insulator, trapping the warm air inside while keeping the cold air outside. The compacted snow has pockets of air, making it hard for the heat to escape. The dome-shaped structure also distributes the interior warmth evenly, preventing any single point from getting too hot. Additionally, the entrance of the igloo is slightly lower than the main living area, creating a cold air trap that prevents warm air from escaping. While a small amount of melting may occur on the inner wall, the cold temperatures outside maintain the overall structure and prevent large-scale melting.	Warm is relative term. If it's 10° below zero and -30 with the wind chill, you will automatically feel 20° warmer in an igloo since it blocks the wind. Then it will also trap body heat which could get it up to 25 or 30°. At that point the feels like temperature could be 60° warmer than outside, but still be below freezing. Also, the blocks of an igloo are quite thick, so even if the air inside is a bit above freezing, it won't completely melt the igloo. The inside layer of snow and ice might start to warm up a bit, but it will also constantly be cooled by the rest of the ice block.

If electrons (and other particles) are simply energy, and are not made of matter, then how does matter exist? I know mass and energy are interchangeable but I'm unable to wrap my head around how different elementary particles, which are made up of energy give rise to different elements that we can touch, feel, see etc. How does nothing (energy but not material) give rise to something that has distinct properties?	"We don't know. We consider them ""fundamental"" because it appears (as far as we can tell) that they aren't ""made"" of anything simpler. There are hypotheses that fundamental particles are made up of something simpler (such as strings in string theory) but nothing with any empirical evidence. They *are* made of matter if simply for the tautological reason that we have defined matter to be the thing that gives them mass. The properties of the fundamental particles arise from differences in mass, charge, and spin. The differences in elements come from the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons, with emphasis on how the electrons are organized about the nucleus. This determines how stable it is and the kinds of bonds it forms with other elements."	"An electron is a fundamental particle, meaning it's not made up of smaller particles. The ""material"" composition of electrons and other fundamental particles is not like regular matter that's made of atoms. Instead, these particles are described by their properties, like mass and charge. When electrons and other particles come together in specific ways, they form atoms, which then combine to make molecules and eventually create the materials we touch, feel, and see. Think of fundamental particles as the building blocks of matter. While they may not have a physical composition like normal matter, their specific arrangement and interaction with each other give rise to the properties and characteristics of the different elements around us."

As far as we know absolutely no information could have been preserved from “before” the big bang to afterwards. Therefore there will never be a testable theory. We could hypothetically discover in the future the existence of additional universes and may then develop a theory of how ours occurred and if something existed before it. But we’ll likely never know even in that scenario whether our universe was the first or if it came into existence at the same time as those hypothetical additional universes. For all intents and purposes nothing existed before the big bang including time.	"The most credible theory for what existed before the big bang is the concept of a ""cosmic singularity. "" this idea suggests that all the matter, energy, and space of the universe were once compressed into an infinitely small and dense point. Some scientists also propose the ""multiverse"" theory, which posits that our universe is just one among many others that may have undergone their own big bangs. Both ideas aim to explain the origins of the universe, but the true nature of the universe's beginning remains a complex and ongoing area of scientific inquiry."

"It is certainly possible, but once something is cut, there tends to be formation of compounds like oxides etc that interfere. So that might be a problem. Otherwise, it is possible to have cold welds or perhaps even weld things together by very high pressures. This might not be too useful if high pressure deforms the material. Usually when joining stuff, you're actually trying to fabricate something and deformation means it goes out of tolerance. There will also be things like poor bonding, cracks etc so it would be hard to ""trust"" the strength of these bonds without very expensive non-destructive testing. Tldr; possible yes, useful no or very expensive and unreliable."	When we cut something, we separate atoms by breaking the bonds between them. These bonds are like tiny magnets holding the atoms together. The reason why atoms don't automatically reconnect when pushed together is due to factors like surface irregularities and external forces. Think of it like puzzle pieces: even if you push two pieces together, they won't stick unless their shapes match perfectly. Similarly, atoms need the right conditions and precise alignment to reconnect, which is difficult to achieve by just pushing the surfaces together. Additionally, since atoms and their bonds are incredibly tiny, even the smallest amount of dirt or air can obstruct a perfect reconnection.

An electric heater device, like an oven, only burns but doesn't electrocute because it's designed to convert electrical energy into heat energy safely. The heating elements, typically made of metal, are insulated from the electric current by a non-conductive material called a heating coil. This prevents direct contact with the electricity, reducing the risk of electrocution. Additionally, modern appliances have safety features like grounding and circuit breakers to protect users from electrical shocks.	* the heating elements are coated in an insulating material. * from the outside it does look like just a big metal coil but there is actually a coating on it that does a very good job of preventing current from traveling anywhere else. * this is impressive since the whole point of the coil is to resist current and thus get really really hot.

It was a hole in a soyuz capsule docked to the iss during soyuz ms-09it took special sensors to detect that it was happening, and once they found it, astronaut alexander gerst supposedly plugged it with his finger, until a cosmonaut fixed it with kapton tape. It was then repaired properly using epoxy sealant. So no, you wouldn't get pushed through like spaghetti by the atmospheric pressure just from a small hole drilled in the iss, but it is still important these holes get patched up before you lose all of your air.	In the ISS, if you drill a small hole, a rapid air leak would occur due to the difference in pressure between the inside of the space station and the vacuum of space. You wouldn't get sucked out because the hole is too small. However, your body wouldn't be able to seal the hole completely, as air would still escape around you. The best course of action would be to use a proper sealing material or patch to cover the hole, stopping the air leak and maintaining the air pressure inside the space station.

I am confused because from the alien’s point of view I am moving super fast. So who ages slower like in ender’s game?	So who ages slower like in ender’s game? Both of you! This is a weird, counter-intuitive aspect of special relativity. As you note, from your perspective you are stationary and the alien is moving, so the alien's clock runs slower than yours (a minute for you could be only 40 seconds for them). But from their perspective, *they* are stationary and you are moving, so your clock runs slower than theirs. And each of your frames of reference is perfectly valid! Which is (kind of) the point of the twin paradox; we have an apparent paradox, both your clocks should run slower than the other's. Oddly enough this actually works out fine as *there is no way for you to compare clocks again* without one of you accelerating (i.e. One of you slowing down to stop with the other), and accelerating is what skews up relative time and space. If a third party gets involved (say someone passes them going the other way and then meets up with you) the maths works out fine from their perspective as well, and they get a result that is consistent with what both you and the alien experience. The maths of special relativity is deceptively simple (largely equations of straight lines), but produces some wonderfully weird results. ---as an afterthought, because you specifically mentioned ender's game; ender's game contradicts special relativity as it hinges on faster-than-light communication. So in the ender's game world this situation doesn't work and you get the paradoxical situation; when the earth military contacts the distant fleets less time should have passed for the fleets than back on earth from the earth's perspective, but less time should have passed on earth than on the fleets from their perspective [disclaimer; I haven't run the numbers to confirm this, but I think it works this way] - the situation is logically impossible.	"In the context of your question, the observer refers to the person or being that is making the observations or measurements. In this case, there are two observers: you sitting on the rock and the alien on the asteroid. The phenomenon you're referring to is called ""time dilation,"" which is a result of einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation occurs when two objects are moving relative to one another at very high speeds, causing the time experienced by one observer to pass more slowly than the time experienced by another observer. To understand this better, let's think about a simpler example. Imagine you have a light clock, which is essentially two mirrors facing each other with light bouncing back and forth between them. Each time the light bounces off a mirror, it counts as one ""tick"" of time. Now, let's say you're holding this light clock while sitting on the rock, and the alien has an identical light clock on the asteroid. From your point of view, the light in your clock is bouncing straight up and down between the mirrors. However, from the alien's point of view, since they're moving at a high speed relative to you, the light in your clock has to travel further by going diagonally, as it moves up and down between the mirrors while also moving sideways due to your relative motion. Because the speed of light is constant, this means that more time passes for the alien's clock to complete one ""tick"" than for your clock. This is time dilation, and it means that from the alien's perspective, your clock - and therefore, you - is aging more slowly. However, from your perspective, it's the alien's clock that's moving diagonally and taking longer to complete a tick, so the alien would be aging more slowly. In other words, both observers would see the other one's clock running slower. This is called the ""twin paradox,"" and it's resolved when something causes the symmetry between the two observers to break, like the alien turning around to come back to you. At that point, you'll be able to compare the two clocks directly, and the one that experienced more acceleration will have aged less. In summary, the observer refers to the person or being making the observations. Time dilation occurs when two objects are moving at high speeds relative to one another, causing"

"If the ship was accelerating, it would ""hang"" toward the back of the ship, as if it was hanging down from a horizontal pole on earth, with no wind. When the ship stopped accelerating, it would spring forward a bit, from released tension, but would then float freely until it reached a point where no forces were acting on it, where it would stay. It's also possible that it might wave a bit from the impact of random particles, but that would be almost undetectable. The density of gas in a very, very dense nebula is about 1,000,000,000,000 times less than our atmosphere, and the vast majority of space is far more empty than that."	In space, a flag on a spaceship would not wave like it does on earth when the spaceship moves. This is because space is a vacuum, meaning there are no air particles for the flag to interact with. On earth, flags wave because of the friction between air particles and the flag's fabric. When the wind blows, air particles push against the flag, causing it to wave. Since there's no air in space, this interaction doesn't occur. However, if a flag was suddenly moved or shook by astronauts, it would vibrate until the movement's energy dissipates, but it wouldn't look like a typical wave we see on earth due to the absence of air resistance.
687	f053c295-7980-49fe-b4c3-21a569b5152a.txt	How do we get energy from both fusion and fission? I heard recently a large hurdle to figuring out fusion energy was overcome and while there are still other challenges to face it’s possible that we could one day see fusion reactors.	So, the answer is that every element secretly “wants” to be nickel-62. Heavier elements are more unstable, and lighter elements are more unstable. This means you can take *most* elements that are lighter than nickel-62 and get energy out by getting them closer to nickel, i.e. By smashing them together so they get heavier - fusion. Similarly, if you take a heavier element, you can get rid of some of its mass and get energy out by getting it closer to nickel - this is fission. Sadly, this means no infinite energy loop. If you try to fuse elements to *beyond* nickel-62, you don’t get energy out. Similarly, if you try to divide atoms smaller than nickel-62, it takes extra energy. The maximum energy you can get out from an element through fusion and fission is the difference between the element’s energy and nickel-62’s energy. **edit:** *lots of good discussion in the comments about whether nickel-62 or iron-56 is more stable. Definitely read through them and Google stuff if you’re interested. **for now, suffice it to say that the general idea of my eli5 is right, and nickel-62/iron-56 difference is small enough that for most practical purposes you can ignore the difference entirely. *	In both fusion and fission, energy is released due to the conversion of mass into energy, as described by einstein's famous equation e=mc^2. Fusion combines lighter elements to form heavier ones, while fission breaks down heavy elements into lighter ones. Fusion energy involves combining two small atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes (for example, deuterium and tritium), at tremendously high temperatures and pressure to form a heavier nucleus, like helium. This process releases excess energy in the form of heat and light. The sun, for example, generates energy through nuclear fusion. Creating sustainable fusion on earth is a challenge because of the extreme conditions needed for fusion reactions to occur, but recent breakthroughs have shown progress towards achieving this goal. Fission energy, on the other hand, involves breaking down heavy atomic nuclei, like uranium-235, into smaller nuclei. This is usually achieved by bombarding the heavy nucleus with a neutron, which causes it to split into two smaller nuclei and release more neutrons along with significant amounts of energy. This process is currently used in nuclear reactors to produce electricity. Theoretically, it is possible to split heavier elements into lighter ones and then fuse them back into heavier ones, but this would not be practical due to the energy required to initiate fusion. The energy needed for fusion is typically higher than that obtained from fission, and the overall process would consume rather than generate energy.

What's the actual, scientific explanation for this?	"Sound is a back and forth motion of air. A wave. If there is a wall, the air can't move back and forth, because it just hits the wall. If the wall is a little bit flexible, then the air can actually move it back and forth, and the wall will now push back and forth on the air past it. This is how sound can pass through walls. Let's forget about walls for a moment. If you are pushing somebody on a swing, what happens if you switch between push and pull too fast? The swing won't actually move very far, and instead you just end up moving yourself quite a lot. If you push too *slowly*, the swing just kind of moves with your hands. It doesn't swing, it just gets dragged around by you. To move the swing the most, you have to go at just the right frequency of pushing and pulling. A sound shaking the wall works just the same. Too high-pitched and it bounces right off, too low-pitched and it will also bounce off. It has to be a frequency in ""the middle"". Different objects have a different ""middle"". Walls' is very low."	"The reason we mostly hear bass through walls, but not the higher notes or melodies, comes down to the properties of sound waves and how they interact with materials like walls. Sound travels through the air in waves, and these waves have different frequencies and wavelengths. Bass sounds have low frequencies and long wavelengths, while higher notes or melodies have higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. When a sound wave encounters a barrier like a wall, its ability to pass through the material depends on the size of the barrier compared to the wavelength. Longer wavelengths (bass sounds) interact less with the barrier, allowing them to pass through more easily. This is because the wall doesn't ""break up"" the sound wave as much. Shorter wavelengths (higher notes) encounter more resistance from the wall and are therefore absorbed or reflected more efficiently. Think of it like a mesh screen. If you toss a large ball at the screen, it will pass through the holes more easily than a small ball, which has a higher chance of hitting the mesh and bouncing back. In this analogy, the large ball represents the bass frequencies and the small ball represents the higher frequencies. That's the scientific explanation for why bass sounds are more likely to pass through walls and can be heard more clearly than higher notes or melodies."

So is f=ma actually mean net force or some other definition?	F=ma refers to the net force acting on an object, which is the total force taking into account all acting forces, such as friction or air resistance. When an object moves at a constant velocity, it means the forces are balanced, resulting in zero net force and zero acceleration. Work refers to the energy transferred when a force is applied over a distance. If an object moves at a constant velocity, it still has work being done against friction or air resistance, but the overall energy transfer is balanced, not zero.	"That analysis is mostly correct although perhaps it makes it easier to think of it not as ""work"" but ""work done"". When thinking about physics problems, the important thing is not to switch contexts. What this means is that the object that is moving at a constant velocity is not doing work or has work being done on it. So from the perspective of the object, there is no gain or loss of energy (for an eli5 the energy is the work content of the object)"

Gravity is the force that keeps us grounded on earth, even when we jump. Although the earth is constantly spinning, everything on its surface, including the atmosphere and us, is spinning with it. This means that when we jump, we're still moving with the earth's rotation, so when we come back down, we land in the same place we started, rather than landing in another location due to the earth's movement.	You are also spinning. The air is spinning. Everything is spinning. Since you have the same rotation rate as the earth, you move horizontally at the same rate as the ground over short time frames. This is fortunate because the earth spins *fast*, nearly 1000mph at the equator. You wouldn’t want to instantly rocket off at supersonic speed if you slipped on a banana peel in Panama.

You need 3 coordinates the length, width, and height to identify exactly where there are at any given moment. And that's the key point about time, depending on what the time or day is that person can be located somewhere entirely different. So time is as important to your location as length, width, and height	Time as a dimension means considering time on the same level as physical space (like length, width, and height). In everyday life, we move through three spatial dimensions, but we also experience change as time passes. Imagine watching a movie: each frame is a snapshot of space at a specific moment, and when played together, they create a sequence of events. Time as a dimension helps us understand and analyze this sequence, similar to how we navigate through space.

It’s the distribution of the force. All that force is coming down on a single point when the bullet hits. Like pushing in a drawing pin, the thin end goes into the wall and the thick end doesn’t hurt your finger because the same force is distributed over a larger area.	The key difference is in the distribution of force. When firing a gun, the recoil force is spread over the larger surface area of the gun's butt, making it less intense. In contrast, a bullet hitting a bulletproof vest concentrates the force on a smaller area, causing a more noticeable impact.

In my head I think the light we see and that is reflected is like waves crashing against a shore.	Light is best described as both a particle called a photon and a wave, a concept known as wave-particle duality. To understand how light behaves, we'll dive into both aspects of light, and then use examples to make the concept more accessible. To start, light is made up of tiny particles called photons. Photons are massless and travel at the speed of light, around 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second). When light travels from one place to another, like from the sun to earth, it does so as a stream of photons moving through space. On the other hand, light also behaves like a wave. Waves are a way to describe how energy travels from one point to another. You can think of waves as being similar to ripples created when you throw a stone into a pond. Light waves have wavelengths, frequencies, and amplitudes. Wavelength is the distance between two peaks of the wave, while frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a point in a given time, and amplitude is the height of the waves. Different colors of light have different wavelengths and frequencies, with red light having a longer wavelength and lower frequency and blue light having a shorter wavelength and higher frequency. Now, you may wonder how light can be both particles (photons) and waves. The answer comes from a famous experiment called the double-slit experiment. Without going into too much detail, this experiment involved shining light through two small slits and observing how it interacts on a screen behind the slits. If light were only particles, we would expect to see two bright bands corresponding to the two slits. However, what was observed were multiple bright and dark bands, similar to what happens when waves interfere with each other (bright bands where the waves add up, and dark bands where they cancel out). This experiment demonstrated that light behaves as both particles and waves. In some situations, it acts like particles (photons), while in others, it behaves like waves (interference and diffraction). This dual nature of light is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics called wave-particle duality. To make this idea more relatable, think of a soccer ball being both a solid object (particle) and the sound it makes when it bounces on the ground (wave). When you're kicking the ball, its particle-like nature is most apparent. However, when you consider how the sound travels through the air and reaches your ears, its wave-like nature becomes more evident. In summary, light is composed of particles called photons that travel through space, while also exhibiting wave-like properties such as interference, which indicates its dual nature. The idea of waves crashing against a shore does not fully capture its behavior since it is not simply an interaction between light and pre-existing photons but rather a combination of particle-like and wave-like properties that define its unique characteristics.	"Well, it's *kind of* both (but not really). The ""sea"" isn't made of photons, but of the elecromagnetic field that exists throughout all of spacetime. Individual photons are packets of energy within that field - essentially, individual ""waves"" with enough energy to be persistent and ""real"". At the quantum level, the field is a frothy ""foam"" of virtual particles popping into and out of existence, temporary particles that appear and disappear almost immediately. Photons are created when a charged particle loses energy. It's like throwing a ball into a pool - the ball has kinetic energy and when it hits the water, it loses that energy, becoming more or less stationary, and the water gains that energy. With photons, it isn't kinetic energy but the idea is kind of similar: the charged particle is energized and when it loses that energy it ""splashes"" in the electromagnetic field to create a photon. When the photon interacts with another charged particle, it energizes that particle - kind of like a wave of water hitting something and disappearing as the energy moves to that thing. Again, with photons it isn't kinetic energy but the point is that the charged particle absorbs the energy from the electromagnetic field, causing it to gain momentum in some direction. This analogy with water is not great, though. Unlike water, the electromagnetic field is not made of particles. It doesn't ""exist"" in the sense that you can't see it and poke it. It's just a sort of blanket of non-zero energy throughout the fabric of spacetime. It *is* the fabric of spacetime (or at least, one ""layer"" or piece of it). The virtual photons that appear and disappear aren't ""real"". There is no sea of photons and the one you see bounces on them. It's a sea of potential - the ability for a photon to exist, if given enough energy. Photons don't really bounce like that. Quantum stuff is... weird. Photons interact with charged particles are either absorbed or not absorbed. A reflection is really a very complicated reaction of a bunch of individual photons that interact and overlap to create a complicated wave form that reflects off of the whole surface of the thing. Individually, the photons are being absorbed by atoms in the surface, exciting the charged particles there into higher energy states, and then those charged particles fall back into lower energy states and emit photons back out, which interact with all the other photons doing the same thing."

Some countries produce too much electricity at a certain period of the year, and have to pay another country to get rid of their extra own unconsumed electricity. Why can't a power plant produce more electricity than consumed, what's the physical obstacle to do so?"	Electricity must be balanced between production and consumption, as storing large amounts of it is difficult and expensive. Imagine a power plant as a water pump and the electrical grid as a system of pipes. The pump needs to maintain constant water flow to prevent pipe bursts (overproduction) or clogs (underproduction). Similarly, a power plant must produce electricity at the same rate it's consumed to maintain a stable electrical frequency and avoid blackouts or damage to the grid. When a country produces too much electricity, it needs to export the surplus to another country. This is akin to diverting some water flow to a neighboring pipe system. The receiving country can either use the extra electricity, or if it's also not needed, they can either store it (limited by storage capacity) or further export it to other countries to maintain balance. The physical obstacle is maintaining the electrical frequency and stability in the power grid. Inefficient management of electricity production and consumption could lead to blackouts, damage to the infrastructure, and increased costs for maintenance and repairs.	The energy has to go somewhere. Power grids can deal with small mismatches in supply and load by allowing the frequency to deviate. A drop in frequency has the effect of reducing the load due to non-eli5 effects like inductive reactance. For large mismatches in supply and demand, simply pushing more energy into the grid will increase frequencies until the grid becomes unstable. The only way to “dump” the energy is to attach more load to dump it into. This could be in the form of batteries, pumped storage, hydrogen generators or anything else. The limiting factor is often the cost of installing new transmission lines. The cost of transmission is often much higher than the cost of generation for renewables. Some thermal power plants are able to dump the excess energy into their cooling system without it ever being turned into electrical power but really it’s best to switch off or throttle down in most cases as it’s just a huge waste of resources unless there is some kind of combined heat and power system.

The light they don't absorb is reflected back at us, and that's the color we see. Take a pane of colored glass that is slightly tinted blue. It looks clear, just a little blue-shifted. Now put another of the exact same panes of glass behind it. It's a darker blue now. Then add another, and another. With each one the blue you see is going to deepen, because each pane of glass adds to the amount of non-blue light being absorbed. The same thing is happening with water, however it reflects so little blue light that it appears clear in smaller quantities. Water itself is almost clear in general, the color we see in it is mostly from tiny impurities within it. So it's not until there's a whole lot of it that there's enough blue light being reflected for us to notice it.	Water appears clear in small quantities but blue in large quantities because of how it interacts with light. In essence, water absorbs colors of light at different rates, with the color blue being absorbed the least and thus more visible. When light enters water, it's made up of numerous colors, similar to a rainbow. As this light passes through the water, the water molecules absorb various colors more quickly than others. Red and yellow colors, for example, are absorbed more rapidly, while blue and green colors penetrate deeper into the water. In small amounts of water, like a glass, the light doesn't travel far enough for significant absorption to occur. As a result, all the colors remain and blend together, making the water appear clear. However, with larger bodies of water like an ocean or a lake, the water absorbs more of the red and yellow colors, leaving primarily blue and green colors to be seen. Since blue is absorbed the least, it becomes the dominant color we observe in large bodies of water.

Prince rupert's drops are created by rapidly cooling molten glass in water. This process causes the exterior to solidify while the interior remains molten. As the interior cools, it contracts, creating a compressive force on the surface. This compression makes the bulbous part of the drop very strong, as external forces have a hard time breaking through the compressed surface. However, the tail is fragile due to the existing tension within the glass. When the tail is broken, it releases the built-up tension, causing the entire drop to shatter. Think of the tail as a trigger, and the internal tension as stored energy. When the trigger is pulled (by breaking the tail), the energy is suddenly released, causing the explosion.	The material of the glass is under stress like a rope pulled taught. This makes the glass exceptionally hard, passing the kinetic energy of any impact over the entire surface exceptionally quickly. That's all hardness is, really. How fast kinetic energy travels across it. The tension comes from how you make a prince rupert's drop. You drop hot, liquid glass into cold water. Cold things contract so the outside layer of the drop contracts before the inside does, causing incredible tension. As for the tail, you could actually cut the drop anywhere with the right tools. The tail is just easier because it's long and thin. This means you have the leverage to bend it until it snaps.

Whether or not you escape my bear hug will be influenced by two things:1. How much energy you can put into struggling2. How tightly I can squeezeif you don't struggle at all then it takes me very little pressure to squeeze you and keep you from escaping, or even to squish you against my chest completely. Similarly, if you can put a lot of energy into struggling then it would take a lot of pressure for me to squeeze you and keep you from breaking free. ____________________________________________________________________________how hard you struggle in this analogy is temperature, or how much kinetic energy a substance has. How tightly I can squeeze in this analogy is atmospheric pressure. So, the less atmospheric pressure, the less kinetic energy it takes for a substance to change from solid to liquid, and again from liquid to gas. Conversely, the greater the atmospheric pressure the more kinetic energy it takes for a phase change to occur. For a static temperature, as atmospheric pressure increases, a substance will change from gas to liquid to solid.	Air pressure plays a significant role in determining the boiling and freezing points of water. In simple terms, air pressure is the force exerted by air molecules on a surface. At higher altitudes, air pressure is lower because there are fewer air molecules to exert force. When it comes to boiling, water turns to steam when its vapor pressure equals the air pressure. Lower air pressure at high altitudes means water will boil at a lower temperature. This is because the vapor pressure of water can reach the reduced air pressure more easily, allowing the water to transition into steam at a lower temperature than it would at sea level. For example, water boils at 100°c (212°f) at sea level, but at an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), it boils at around 90°c (194°f). As for freezing, air pressure has a much less direct effect on the freezing point of water. At standard air pressure, the freezing point lies at 0°c (32°f). However, if the air pressure is radically reduced, like in a laboratory setting, water can freeze at a slightly lower temperature than 0°c. But under normal conditions, it's safe to say that air pressure doesn't significantly change the freezing point of water. In summary, air pressure affects water's boiling point, causing it to boil at lower temperatures when the air pressure is reduced, like at
