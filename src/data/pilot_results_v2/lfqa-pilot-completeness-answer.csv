Also, does not address the question about myofascial release therapy., begin=1272, end=1279)	ANSWER2	"ANSWER2:
A ""muscle knotting up"" is called a ""tetanic contraction"", which means the muscle contracted by a constant stream if nerve impulses telling it to do so. the causes can vary from phycological to chemical to pathological. psychological reasons usually involve stresses and panic. the most common chemical reason it happens is because of a buildup of lactic acid inside of the muscle tissue. the act of contracting a muscle is mostly a chemical reaction started by a nerve impulse to where the muscle tissue uses glucose, then releases lactic acid into the blood to be carried away and (hopefully) neutralized. if your blood flow cannot move it away fast enough, the lactic acid builds up in the muscle tissue and makes the nerve impulses go haywire."	Does not answer about treating knots with heat or ice. Also, does not address the question about myofascial release therapy.

Many necessary biological processes create atoms or molecules called radicals. a radical is an atom or molecule that has an unbound valence electron. that electron wants to become bound. in doing so, it can cause damage to parts of our cells, including dna (look up the free radical theory of aging). oxidants are a type of radical, usually either a single oxygen atom or a hydroxyl radical. anti-oxidants bind with these radicals and neutralize them

QUESTION:
I keep seeing antioxidant foods portrayed as good and healthy, but what are oxidants and why is oxidation bad for the body?"	Does not address the benefits of oxidants.

Antioxidants are important because they protect our cells from damage. the body produces oxidants as a byproduct of normal metabolism, and exposure to tobacco smoke, pollution, and other environmental toxins also can increase the level of oxidants in the body. when these levels become too high, they can damage cells, leading to conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and arthritis."	Does not address the benefits of oxidants.

It talks about interbreeding but does not give reasons., begin=2943, end=2950)	ANSWER2	"(https://knowyourdna.com/humans-same-dna-as-bananas/)

ANSWER2:
> in high school biology i was taught that an important part of the definition of a species is whether or not the offspring can breed true

that is a common, but not ironclad, definition of ""species"". there's no one definition that works universally: it can be ""can but usually *don't* interbreed"" (say, because their ranges don't overlap), or even just ""are genetically and morphologically distinct populations with little gene mixture"". in extreme cases this can get crazy: species a interbreeds with species b which interbreeds with c which interbreeds with d, but a can't interbreed with d."	The answer is not sufficient. It talks about interbreeding but does not give reasons.

The answer does not address the association between taste and touch.
