Many plants will readily grow in water, this is called hydroponics 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydroponics

you can kill a plant by overwatering it by drowning the roots, or by adding too much water too often and not allowing the plant to dry out some between watering, this can cause root rot which is fatal, or by adding chemicals or fertilizers to the water which can build up and become toxic

QUESTION:
How can i kill a plant by overwatering it, yet propagations of the same plant will grow in water?"	This part does not tell useful information for answering the question. This information is also not used in the later part of the answer.
