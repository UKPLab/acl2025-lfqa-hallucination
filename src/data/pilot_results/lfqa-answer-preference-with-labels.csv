1|037f220f-7797-4b35-bcf0-201336c4127b.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|Although Answer 1 and Answer 2 have mentioned similar points, Answer 2 organizes them in a more structured way. It talks about the warmth inside and outside of our body. Answer 2 also explains the blood vessel dilation better.|model_answer|human_answer
2|075398ee-9f9f-4ff7-97aa-7d0315844130.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both the answers are not satisfactory and only answer a part of the question. I chose answer 1 because it is relatively easier to understand and to the point. The answer 2 is a bit hard to understand and the grammar is not the best. Although answer 2 gives some references about the diseases caused by knots but this is not enough.|model_answer|human_answer
3|075398ee-9f9f-4ff7-97aa-7d0315844130.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|"It is hard to choose which answer is better. Answer 1 addresses all parts in the question while Answer 2 provides very good explanation why muscles knot up and gives suggestions how to avoid it. 

Answer 1 says ""that causes pain in other parts of the body"". It is not clear to me why it is the case and what are the other parts of the body.

Overall, I think Answer 2 flows better and offers comprehensive information to the parts of the question that it answers."|model_answer|human_answer
4|03fd2c88-e3e9-4ba5-8641-fa7814df6b08.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both the answers are not really convincing but the answer 1 gives a concise reason as to why we don't keep our backs straight. The answer 2 is not complete and does not address the question asked.|model_answer|human_answer
5|03fd2c88-e3e9-4ba5-8641-fa7814df6b08.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|Neither answer is ideal. Answer 2 says Homo sapiens did not evolve in an environment in which they often sat. But it doesn't say how this explain why we tend to have bad postures directly.|model_answer|human_answer
6|031d790a-7d9d-498e-a36d-a28eaca304ac.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both answers are easy to follow and sufficient to answer the question but answer 1 is a bit more detailed and thus the preference here.|human_answer|model_answer
7|031d790a-7d9d-498e-a36d-a28eaca304ac.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|Answer 2 doesn't answer the first part of the question.|human_answer|model_answer
8|0242d81a-2c1b-4021-9aa1-c5cfcf38a784.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both answers are sufficient in this case but answer 1 gives references and is concise and easy to understand.|model_answer|human_answer
9|0242d81a-2c1b-4021-9aa1-c5cfcf38a784.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|The last sentence in Answer 2 nicely answers the puzzle raised in the second half of the question and the rest part of it nicely answers how overwatering can kill a plant.|model_answer|human_answer
10|05b4333c-1c42-4ede-b62c-830c38cbfea2.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|The answer 1 addresses the question completely with a step by step explanation of why the bright light leaves a mark in our vision. On the other hand, the answer 2 has repetitive and uninformative information.|human_answer|model_answer
11|05b4333c-1c42-4ede-b62c-830c38cbfea2.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|Answer 2 has repetition and doesn't explain why the image floats in our field of vision.|human_answer|model_answer
12|00f64ae1-c96a-4b2e-9912-c40e295e2565.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|The answer 1 answers the question partially by giving some reasons whereas the answer 2 does not answer it at all and just talks about irrelevant things.|model_answer|human_answer
13|00f64ae1-c96a-4b2e-9912-c40e295e2565.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|"I am not sure whether the part ""such as viruses"" is correct or not but it doesn't look correct to me.

Answer 1 has one sentence that does nothing but simply repeats the question ""in people with type 1 diabetes , the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas."" Answer 1 is also largely irrelevant because the question asks about our immune system attack our own cells but Answer 1 talks about foreign invaders.

Answer 2 is not great. It only says this attack happens because our body fails to do certain things but doesn't say why our body fails to do so. 

Overall, Answer 2 is more relevant and concise but not the best possible answer."|model_answer|human_answer
14|03235d4c-dcb0-4cac-8dc2-5d17b072f5ac.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both answers seem correct but answer 1 is better for the following reasons: firstly, it describes what a sneeze does and secondly, it gives a very detailed answer. The answer 2 has some irrelevant sentences but also explains how a sneeze works.|human_answer|model_answer
15|03235d4c-dcb0-4cac-8dc2-5d17b072f5ac.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|"Answer 2 introduces some fun facts about sneezing such as ""in fact, a sneeze is one of the fastest human body reactions."" but these are not closely related to the questions. Also, compared to Answer 1 which talks about how the sneeze reaction is triggered (i.e., the cilia are bent), Answer 2 misses such information."|human_answer|model_answer
16|03804547-6f04-472b-82fc-bf073985dfc2.txt|rachneet|Answer 2|Both answers are correct but the answer 2 gives a better explanation while describing alternate methodologies for the freezing of sperms.|model_answer|human_answer
17|03804547-6f04-472b-82fc-bf073985dfc2.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|"Answer 1 has one contradiction. In the first sentence, it says ""they are able to dehydrate themselves"" but later it says ""the sperm is dehydrated"". 

Answer 2 introduces two methods of freezing cells and is more comprehensive."|model_answer|human_answer
18|02062ffd-f0bb-4566-847c-fc7057d4ce0b.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|The answer 1 gives a detailed explanation with example. The answer 2 does not seem factually correct.|human_answer|model_answer
19|02062ffd-f0bb-4566-847c-fc7057d4ce0b.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|"Answer 1 has too many irrelevant parts and I do not understand how the fluid and heart pulse together make the pain feel come in pulses or waves.

Answer 2 makes it clear that the reason is the neurons. 

Overall, Answer 2 is to the point and concise."|human_answer|model_answer
20|0725d873-e32c-4c8e-bbcf-8e3eb6a8a0cd.txt|rachneet|Answer 2|The answer 2 addresses the actual health benefits of exercise and explains why sweating is not the only thing that happens when we exercise. On the other hand, the answer 1 is not sufficient since it does not list any actual health benefits.|model_answer|human_answer
21|0725d873-e32c-4c8e-bbcf-8e3eb6a8a0cd.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|"Neither answer is great.

Answer 2 is totally not to the point to what the question asks. 

Answer 1 understand ""health benefits"" as being safe. But I believe the question asks whether sweating from heat can improve our health."|model_answer|human_answer
22|059fa085-f357-478a-83c1-fc5933bbad6a.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Both answers address the question partially but the answer 1 gives relevant references which makes it a better answer. Also, the answer 1 gives a more in-depth answer by explaining the biology behind the oxidants.|human_answer|model_answer
23|059fa085-f357-478a-83c1-fc5933bbad6a.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|"Neither answer is ideal. 

Answer 1 doesn't answer the last part of the question. Answer 2 doesn't go into details and stays superficial. Overall, Answer 1 is more informative."|human_answer|model_answer
24|04ac3833-c4d7-4bcb-a3f4-f133819ef4df.txt|rachneet|Answer 2|Both answers address the question but the answer2 has more meaningful examples and the explanation is straightforward.|human_answer|model_answer
25|04ac3833-c4d7-4bcb-a3f4-f133819ef4df.txt|yixiao|Answer 2|"Answer 2 addresses all parts of the question but has irrelevant parts.

Answer 1 uses analogy to explain what happens in brain when we are sleeping. However, it doesn't actually answer how can the brain get rest while being active to some extend."|human_answer|model_answer
26|02408398-02c5-4afc-866d-4225e869d49a.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|The answer 1 gives a clear explanation for the different definitions of species and how they are different. The answer 2 does not answer the question but just speak about breeding between species.|model_answer|human_answer
27|02408398-02c5-4afc-866d-4225e869d49a.txt|yixiao|Answer 1|"Answer 2 has irrelevant parts that do not answer the questions.

28|06210903-a207-4171-901b-45d89165bec3.txt|rachneet|Answer 1|Answer 1 is better because it gives reference to a common numbing agent and then explains the reason why we cannot taste when our tongue is numb. The answer 2 is very generic and not completely sufficient.|model_answer|human_answer
