The perception of warmth internally is caused by the fact that your interior tissues are sensitive and alcohol is a corrosive chemical: it literally burns your tissues. the perception of warmth outside your body is caused by blood vessel dilation. heat is picked up from muscle activity by blood and distributed throughout the body. when your blood vessels dilate (due to being to hot, consuming alcohol, or a series of other reasons), the heat leaves through the skin.","blood vessels dilate (due to being to hot, consuming alcohol, or a series of other reasons),"

Many plants will readily grow in water, this is called hydroponics

you can kill a plant by overwatering it by drowning the roots, or by adding too much water too often and not allowing the plant to dry out some between watering, this can cause root rot which is fatal, or by adding chemicals or fertilizers to the water which can build up and become toxic

The reason why cells usually die when frozen is that the water contained in them forms ice crystals with sharp edges and points which also take up more space than the water they have formed from. these crystals destroy the internal cell structures and its outer membrane, so the cell basically is burst open. sperm cells are very small and have lower water content than other human cell types and for this reason they are more capable of surviving freezing. to improve the odds of survival, cryoprotectors like glycerol are also added which inhibit crystal growth. another, even better technique is vitrification which uses super fast cooling to extremely low temperatures (like down to almost -200 °c in less than a second). this makes the water pass through to a glass-like solid state without forming crystals. this is the preferred method for egg cell and embryo cryopreservation,  because those, unlike sperm cells, are few and hard to come by.","this is the preferred method for egg cell and embryo cryopreservation,  because those, unlike sperm cells, are few and hard to come by"

Many necessary biological processes create atoms or molecules called radicals. a radical is an atom or molecule that has an unbound valence electron. that electron wants to become bound. in doing so, it can cause damage to parts of our cells, including dna (look up the free radical theory of aging). oxidants are a type of radical, usually either a single oxygen atom or a hydroxyl radical. anti-oxidants bind with these radicals and neutralize them

The active ingredient in most topical numbing agents is lidocaine. lidocaine works by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels on neurons. this prevents the neurons from sending action potentials (signals) to the brain. when lidocaine is applied to the tongue, it prevents the taste buds from sending action potentials to the brain. this is why you can't taste when your tongue is numb.",The active ingredient in most topical numbing agents is lidocaine.
